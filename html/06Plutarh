  <h2 id="plutarchs-essays">Plutarch’s essays</h2>

  <h3 id="themes-of-ensuing-chapters">Themes of ensuing chapters</h3>

  <p>Having noted the presence of magic in works so especially devoted to natural science as those of Pliny, Galen, and Ptolemy, we have now to illustrate the prominence both of natural science and of magic in the life and thought of the Roman Empire by a consideration of some writers of a more miscellaneous character, who should reflect for us something of the interests of the average cultured reader of that time. Of this type are Plutarch, Apuleius and Philostratus, whom we shall consider in the coming chapters in the order named, which also roughly corresponds to their chronological sequence.</p>

  <h3 id="life-of-plutarch">Life of Plutarch</h3>

  <p>Plutarch flourished during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian at the turn of the first and second centuries, but <em>The Letter on the Education of a Prince to Trajan</em> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> probably is not by him, and the legend that Hadrian was his pupil is a medieval invention.</p>

  <p>He was born in Boeotia about 46-48 A. D. and was educated in rhetoric and philosophy, science and mathematics, at Athens, where he was a student when Nero visited Greece in 66 A. D. He also made several visits to Rome and resided there for some time. He held various public positions in the province of Achaea and in his small native town of Chaeronea, and had official connections with the Delphic oracle and amphictyony. Artemidorus in the Oneirocriticon states that Plutarch’s death was foreshadowed in a dream. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="superstition-in-plutarchs-lives">Superstition in Plutarch’s Lives</h3>

  <p>With Plutarch’s celebrated Lives of Illustrious Men, as with narrative histories in general, we shall not be much concerned, although they of course abound in omens and portents, in bits of pseudo-science which details in his narrative bring to the mind of the biographer, and in cases of divination and magic. Thus theories are advanced to explain why birds dropped dead from mid-air at the shout set up by the Greeks at the Isthmian games when Flamininus proclaimed their freedom. Or we are told how Sulla received from the Chaldeans predictions of his future greatness, how in the dedication to his Memoirs he admonished Lucullus to trust in dreams, and how Lucullus’s mind was deranged by a love philter administered by his freedman in the hope of increasing his master’s affection towards him. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> Such allusions and incidents abound also of course in Dio Cassius, Tacitus, and other Roman historians.</p>

  <h3 id="his-morals-or-essays.">His Morals or Essays.</h3>

  <p>But we shall be concerned rather with Plutarch’s other His writings, which are usually grouped together under the title of <em>Morals</em>, or, more appropriately, <em>Miscellanies and Essays</em>. Not only is there great variety in their titles, but in any given essay the attention is usually not strictly held to one theme or problem but the discussion diverges to other points. Some are by their very titles and form rambling dialogues, symposiacs, and table-talk, where the conversation lightly flits from one topic to other entirely different ones, never dwelling for long upon any one point and never returning to its starting-point. This dinner-table and drinking-bout type of cultured and semi-learned discourse has other extant ancient examples such as the <em>Attic Nights</em> of Aulus Gellius and the <em>Deipnosophists</em> of Athenaeus, but Plutarch will have to serve as our main illustration of it. His Essays reflect in motley guise and disordered array the fruits of extensive reading and a retentive memory in ancient philosophy, science, history, and literature.</p>

  <h3 id="question-of-their-authenticity.">Question of their authenticity.</h3>

  <p>The authenticity of some of the essays attributed to him has been questioned, and very likely with propriety, but for our purpose it is not important that they should all be by the same author so long as they represent approximately the same period and type of literature. The spurious treatise, <em>De placitis philosophorimi</em>, we have already considered in the chapter on Galen, to whom it has also been ascribed. The essay On Rivers and Mountains we shall treat by itself in the present chapter. The De fato has also been called spurious. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>

  <p>Superstitious content is not a sufficient reason for denying that a treatise is by Plutarch, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> since he is superstitious in writings of undoubted genuineness and since we have found the leading scientists of the time unable to exclude superstition from their works entirely. Moreover, many of the essays are in the form of conversations expressing the divergent views of different speakers, and it is not always possible to tell which shade of opinion Plutarch himself favors. Suffice it that the views expressed are those of men of education.</p>

  <h3 id="magic-in-plutarch.">Magic in Plutarch.</h3>

  <p>Plutarch does not specifically discuss magic under that name at any length in any of his essays, but does treat of such subjects as superstition in general, dreams, oracles, demons, number, fate, the craftiness of animals, and other “natural questions.” Certain vulgar forms of magic, at least, were regarded by him with disapproval or incredulty. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>

  <p>He rejects as a fiction the statement that the women of Thessaly can draw down the moon by their spells, but thinks that the notion perhaps originated in the fact or story that Aglaonice, daughter of Hegetor, was so skilful in astrology or astronomy as to be able to foresee the occurrence of lunar eclipses, and that she deluded the people into believing that at such times she brought down the moon from heaven by charms and enchantments. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup> Thus we have one more instance of the union of magic and science, this time of pseudo-magic with real science as at other times of magic with pseudo-science.</p>

  <h3 id="essay-on-superstition">Essay on Superstition</h3>

  <p>The essay entitled “περὶ δεισιδαιμονίας - superstitious” deals with superstition in the usual Greek sense of dread or excessive fear of demons and gods. We are accustomed to think of Hellenic paganism as a cheerful faith, full of naturalism, in which the gods were humanized and made familiar. Plu- tarch apparently regards normal religion as of this sort, and attacks the superstitious dread of the supernatural. He contends that such fear is worse, if anything, than atheism, for it makes men more unhappy and is an equal offense against the divinity, since it is at least as bad to believe ill of the gods as not to believe in them at all. Nothing indeed encourages the growth of atheism so much as the absurd practices and beliefs of such superstitious persons,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“their words and motions, their sorceries and magics, their runnings to and fro and beatings of drums, their impure rites and their purifications, their filthiness and chastity-, their barbarian and illegal chastisements and abuse.” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Plutarch seems to be in part animated by the common prejudice against all other religions than cHie’s own. and speaks twice with dis- taste of Jewish Sabbaths. He also, however, as the passage just quoted shows, is opposed to the more extreme and debasing forms of magic, and declares that the superstitious man becomes a mere peg or post upon which all the oldwives hang any amulets and ligatures upon which they may chance. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup></p>

  <p>He further condemns such historic instances of superstition as Xicias’s suspension of military operations during a lunar eclipse on the Sicilian expedition. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup></p>

  <p>There was nothing terrible, says Plutarch, with his usual felicity of antithesis, in the periodic reoirrence of the earth’s shadow upon the moon; but it was a terrible calamity that the shadow of superstition should thus darken the mind of a general at the very moment when a great crisis required the fullest use of his reason.</p>

  <h3 id="plutarch-hospitable-toward-some-superstitions.">Plutarch hospitable toward some superstitions.</h3>

  <p>In the essay upon the demon of Socrates one of the speakers, attacking faith in dreams and apparitions, commends Socrates as one who did not reject the worship of the gods but who did purify philosophy, which he had re- ceived from Pythagoras and Empedocles full of phantasms and myths and the dread of demons, and reeling like a Bacchanal, and reduced it to facts and reason and truth. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup></p>

  <p>Another of the company, however, objects that the demon of Socrates outdid the divination of Pythagoras. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup></p>

  <p>These conflicting opinions may be applied in some measiu-e to Plutarch himself. His censtu"e of dread of demons and excessive superstition is not to be taken as a sign of scepticism on his part in oracles, dreams, or the demons themselves. To these matters we next turn.</p>

  <h3 id="the-oracles-of-delphi-and-of-trophonius.">The oracles of Delphi and of Trophonius.</h3>

  <p>Plutarch’s faith and interest in oracles in general and in the Delphian oracle ot Apollo in particular are attested by three of his essays, the <em>De defectu oraculorum, De Pythiae oraculis</em> and <em>De Ei apud Delphos</em>. At the same time these essays attest the decline of the oracles from their earlier popularity" and greatness. The oracular cave of Trophonius, of which we shall hear again in the <em>Life of Apollonius of Tyana</em>, also comes into Plutarch’s works, and the prophetic and apocal}'ptic vision is described of a youth who spent two nights and a day there in an endeavor to learn the nature of the demon of Socrates. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="divination-justified.">Divination justified.</h3>

  <p>Plutarch further had faith in divination in general, Divination whether by dreams, sneezes or other omens: but he attempted to give a dignified philosophical and theological explanation of it. Few men receive direct divine revelation, in his opinion, but to many signs are given on which divination may be based. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup></p>

  <p>He held that the human soul had a natural faculty of divination which might be exercised at favorable times and when the bodily state was not unfavorable. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup></p>

  <p>A speaker in one of his dialogues justifies divination even from sneezes and like trivial occurrences upon the ground that as the faint beat of the pulse has meaning for the physician and a small cloud in the sky - is for a skilful pilot a sign of impending storm, so the least thing may be a clue to the truly - prophetic soul. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup></p>

  <p>The extent of Plutarch’s faith in dreams may be inferred from his discussion of the problem. Why are dreams in autumn the least reliable? <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup></p>

  <p>First there is Aristotle’s suggestion that eating autumn fruit so disturbs the digestion that the soul is left little opportunity to exercise its prophetic faculty undistracted. If we accept the doctrine of Democritus that dreams are caused by images from other bodies and even minds or souls, which enter the body of the sleeper through the open pores and affect the mind, revealing to it the present passions and future designs of others, - if we accept this theory, it may be that the falling leaves in autumn disturb the air and ruffle these extremely thin and film-like emanations. A third explanation offered is that in the declining months of the year all our faculties, including that of natural divination, are in a state of decline. In the case of oracles like that at Delphi it is suggested that the Pythia’s natural faculty of divination is stimulated by “the prophetical exhalations from the earth” which induce a bodily state favorable to divination. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup></p>

  <p>The god or demon, however, is the underlying and directing cause of the oracle. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="demons-as-mediators-between-gods-and-men">Demons as mediators between gods and men</h3>

  <p>To the demons and their relations to the gods and to men we therefore next come. Plutarch’s view is that they are essential mediators between the gods and men. Just as one who should remove the air from between the earth and moon would destroy the continuity of the universe, so those who deny that there is a race of demons break ofif all inter- course between gods and men. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup></p>

  <p>On the other hand, the theory of demons solves many doubts and difficulties. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup></p>

  <p>When and where this doctrine originated is uncertain, whether among the magi about Zoroaster, or in Thrace with Orpheus, or in Egypt or Phrygia.<br/> Plutarch likens the gods to an equilateral, the demons to an isosceles, and human beings to a scalene triangle; and again compares the gods to sun and stars, the demons to the moon, and men to comets and meteors. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup></p>

  <p>In the youth’s vision in the cave of Trophonius the moon appeared to belong to earthly demons, while those stars which have a regular motion were the demons of sages, and the wandering and falling stars the demons of men who have yielded to irrational passions. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="demons-in-the-moon-migration-of-the-soul.">Demons in the moon: migration of the soul.</h3>

  <p>These suggestions that the moon and the air between earth and moon are the abode of the demons and this reminiscence of the Platonic doctrine of the soul and its migrations receive further confirmation in a discussion whether the moon is inhabited in the essay, <em>On the Face in the Moon</em>. A story is there told <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup> of a man who visited islands five days’ sail west of Britain, where Saturn is imprisoned and where there are demons serving him.</p>

  <p>This man who acquired great skill in astrology during his stay there stated upon his return to Europe that every soul after leaving the human body wanders for a time between earth and moon, but finally reaches the latter planet, where the Elysian fields are located, and there becomes a demon. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup></p>

  <p>The demons do not always remain in the moon, however, but may come to earth to care for oracles or be imprisoned in a human body again for some crime. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup></p>

  <p>The man who repeats the stranger’s story leaves it to his hearers, however, to believe it or not. But the struggle upward of human souls to the estate of demons is again described in the essay on the demon of Socrates, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup></p>

  <p>where it is explained that those souls which have succeeded in freeing themselves from all union with the flesh become guardian demons and help those of their fellows whom they can reach, just as men on shore wade out as far as they can into the waves to rescue those sea-tossed, shipwrecked mariners who have succeeded in struggling almost to land. The soul is plunged into the body, the uncorrupted mind or demon remains without. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="demons-mortal-some-evil.">Demons mortal: some evil.</h3>

  <p>The demons differ from the gods in that they are mortal, though much longer-lived than men. Hesiod said that crows live nine times as long as men, stags four times as long as crows, ravens three times as long as stags, a phoenix nine times as long as a raven, and the nymphs ten times as long as the phoenix. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup></p>

  <p>There are storms in the isles off Britain when- ever one of the demons residing there dies." <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup></p>

  <p>Some demons are good spirits and others are evil ; some are more passive and irrational than others ; some delight in gloomy festivals, foul words, and even human sacrifice. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="men-and-demons.">Men and demons.</h3>

  <p>Once a year in the neighborhood of the Red Sea a man is seen who spends the remainder of his time among “nymphs, nomads and demons.” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup></p>

  <p>At his annual appearance many princes and great men come to consult him concerning the future. He also has the gift of tongues to the extent of understanding several languages perfectly. His speech is like sweetest music, his breath sweet and fragrant, his person the most graceful that his interlocutor had ever seen. He also was never afflicted with any disease, for once a month he ate the bitter fruit of a medicinal herb. As to the exact nature of Socrates’ demon there is some diversity of opinion. One man suggests that it was merely the sneezing of himself or others, sneezes on the left hand warning him to desist from his intended course of action, while a sneeze in any other quarter was interpreted by him as a favorable sign. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup></p>

  <p>The weight of opinion, however, inclines to- wards the view that his demon did not appear to him as an apparition or phantasm, or even communicate with him as an audible voice, but by immediate impression upon his mind. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="relation-of-plutarchs-to-other-conceptions-of-demons.">Relation of Plutarch’s to other conceptions of demons.</h3>

  <p>Plutarch’s account of demons is the first of a number which we shall have occasion to note. As the discussion of them by Apuleius in the next chapter and the rather crude representation of them given in Philostratus’s <em>Life of Apollonius of Tyana</em> will show, there was as yet among non- Christian writers no unanimity of opinion concerning demons. On the other hand there are several conceptions in Plutarch’s essays which were to be continued later by Christians and Neo-Platonists: namely, the conception of a mediate class of beings between God and men, the hypothesis of a world of spirits in close touch with human life, the association of divination and oracles with demons, and the location of spirits in the sphere of the moon or the air between earth and moon, - although Plutarch sometimes connected demons with the stars above the moon. This occasional association of stars with spirits and of sinning souls with falling stars bears some resemblance to the depiction of certain stars as sinners in the Hebraic <em>Book of Enoch</em>, which was written before Plutarch’s time and which we shall consider in our next book as an influence upon the development of early Christian thought.</p>

  <h3 id="the-astrologer-tarrutius.">The astrologer Tarrutius.</h3>

  <p>As for the stars apart from demons, Plutarch discusses the art of astrology as little as he does “magic” by that name. Mentions of individuals as skilled in “astrology” may simply mean that they were trained astronomers. When a veritable astrologer in our sense of the word is mentioned in one of Plutarch’s Lives, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup> he is described as a μαθηματικός - mathimatikós - matematician - a word often used for a caster of horoscopes and predicter of the future.</p>

  <p>Here, however, it carries no reproach of charlatanism, since in the same phrase he is called a philosopher. This Tarrutius was a friend of Varro, who asked him to work out the horoscope of Romulus backward from what was known of the later life and character of the founder of Rome.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“For it was possible for the same science which predicted man’s life from the time of his birth to infer the time of his birth from the events of his life.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Tarrutius set to work and from the data at his disposal figured out that Romulus was conceived in the first year of the second Olympiad, on the twenty-third day of the Egyptian month Khoeak at the third hour when there was a total eclipse of the sun; and that he was born on the twenty-first day of the month Thoth about sunrise. He further estimated that Rome was founded by him on the ninth day of the month Pharmuthi between the second and third hour. For, adds Plutarch, they think that the fortunes of cities are also controlled by the hour of their genesis. Plutarch, however, seems to look upon such doctrines as rather strange and fabulous. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup><br/> Varro, on the other hand, may have regarded it as the most scientific method possible of settling disputed questions of historical chronology.</p>

  <h3 id="de-fato.">De fato.</h3>

  <p>A favorable attitude towards astrology is found mainly in those essays by Plutarch which are suspected of being spurious, the <em>De fato</em> and <em>De placitis philosophorum</em>. Of the latter we have already treated under Galen. In the former fate is described as</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“the soul of the universe,”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and the three main divisions of the universe, namely, the immovable heaven, the moving spheres and heavenly bodies, and the region about the earth, are associated with the three Fates, Clotho, Atropos, and Lachesis. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup></p>

  <p>It is similarly stated in the essay on the demon of Socrates <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup> that of the four principles of all things, life, motion, genesis or genera- tion, and corruption, the first two are joined by the One indivisibly, the second and third Mind unites through the sun; the third and fourth Nature joins through the moon.</p>

  <p>And over each of these three bonds presides one of the three Fates, Atropos, Clotho, and Lachesis.</p>

  <p>In other words, the one God or first cause, invisible and unmoved, in whom is life, sets in motion the heavenly spheres and bodies, through whose instrumentality generation and corruption upon earth are produced and regulated, - which is substantially the Aristotelian view of the universe.</p>

  <p>Returning to the De fato we may note that it repeats the Stoic theory of the magnus anntis when the heavenly bodies resume their rounds and all history repeats itself. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup></p>

  <p>Despite this apparent admission that human life is subject to the movements of the stars, the author of the <em>De fato</em> seems to think that accident, fortune or chance, the contingent, and “what is in us” or free-will, can all co-exist with fate, which he practically identifies with the motion of the heavenly bodies, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup></p>

  <p>Fate is also comprehended by divine Providence but this fact does not militate against astrology, since Providence itself divides into that of the first God, that of the secondary gods or stars</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"who move through the heavens regulating mortal affairs, and that of the demons who act as guardians of men. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3 id="other-bits-of-astrology.">Other bits of astrology.</h3>

  <p>One or two bits of astrology may be noted in Plutarch’s Other other essays. The man who learned “astrology” among demons in the isle beyond Britain affirmed that in human generation earth supplies the body, the moon furnishes the soul, and the sun provides the intellect. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup></p>

  <p>In the <em>Symposiacs</em> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup> the opinion of the mythographers is repeated that monstrous animals were produced during the war with the giants because the moon turned from its course then and rose in unaccustomed quarters.<br/> Plutarch was, by the way, inclined to distinguish the moon from other heavenly bodies as passive and imperfect, a sort of celestial earth or terrestrial star. Such a separation of the moon from the other stars and planets would have, however, no necessary contrariety with astrological theory, which usually ascribed a peculiar place to the moon and represented it as the medium through which the more distant planets exerted their effects upon the earth.</p>

  <h3 id="cosmic-mysticism.">Cosmic mysticism.</h3>

  <p>Sometimes Plutarch’s cosmology carries Platonism to Cosmic the verge of Gnosticism, a subject of which we shall treat in a later chapter. The diviner who had communed with demons, nomads, and nymphs in the desert asserted that there was not one world, but one hundred and eighty-three worlds arranged in the form of a triangle with sixty to each side and one at each angle. Within this triangle of worlds lay the plain of truth where were the ideas and models of all things that had been or were to be, and about these was eternity from which time flowed off like a river to the one hundred and eighty-three worlds.<br/> The vision delectable of those ideas is granted to men only once in a myriad of years, if they live well, and is the goal toward which all philosophy strives. The stranger, we are informed, told this tale artlessly, like one in the mysteries, and produced no demonstration or proof of what he said. We have already heard Plutarch liken gods, demons, and men to different kinds of triangles; he also repeats Plato’s association of the five regular solids with the elements, earth, air, fire, water, and ether. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup></p>

  <p>He states that the nature of fire is quite apparent in the pyramid from</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“the slenderness of its decreasing sides and the sharpness of its angles,” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and that fire is engendered from air when the octahedron is dissolved into pyramids, and air produced from fire when the pyramids are compressed into an octahedron. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="number-mysticism.">Number mysticism.</h3>

  <p>These geometrical fancies are naturally accompanied by considerable number mysticism. In this particular passage the merits of the number five are enlarged upon and a long list is given of things that are five in number. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup></p>

  <p>Five is again extolled in the essay on <em>The Ei at Delphi</em>, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup> but there one of the company remarks with much reason that it is possible to praise any number in many ways,</p>

  <p>but that he prefers to five “the sacred seven of Apollo.” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup></p>

  <p>Platonic geometrical reveries and Pythagorean number mysticism are indulged in even more extensively in the essay <em>On the Procreation of the Soul in Timaeus</em>.<br/> The number and proportion existing in planets, stars and spheres are touched on, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup></p>

  <p>and it is stated that the divine demiurge produced the marvelous virtues of drugs and organs by employing harmonies and numbers. [^13:8] Thus in the potency of number and numerical relations is suggested a possible explanation of astrology^and magic force in nature.</p>

  <p>[^13:8] : Cap. 33.</p>

  <h3 id="occult-virtues-in-nature.">Occult virtues in nature.</h3>

  <p>Plutarch, indeed, shows the same faith in the existence of occult virtues in natural objects and in what may be called natural magic as most of his contemporaries. At his symposium when one man avers that he saw the tiny fish echene’is stop the ship upon which he was sailing until the look-out man picked it off, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup></p>

  <p>some laugh at his credulity but others narrate other cases of strange antipathies in nature. Mad elephants are quieted by the sight of a ram; vipers will not move if touched with a leaf from a beech tree; wild bulls become tame when tied to a fig tree; <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup> if light objects are oiled, amber fails to attract them as usual; and iron rubbed with garlic does not respond to the magnet,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“These things are proved by experience but it is difficult if not quite impossible to learn their cause.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>At the Symposium <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup> the question also is raised why salt is called divine, and it is suggested that it may be because it preserves bodies from decay after the soul has left them, or because mice conceive without sexual intercourse by merely licking salt.</p>

  <p>In <em>The Delay of the Deity</em> Plutarch again treats of occult virtues. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup> They pass from body to body with incredible swiftness or to an incredible distance. He wonders why it is that if a goat takes a piece of sea-holly in her mouth, the entire herd will stand still until the goatherd removes it. We see once more how closely such notions are associated with magical practices, when in the same paragraph he mentions the custom of making the children of those who have died of consumption or dropsy sit soaking their feet in water until the corpse has been buried so that they may not catch their parent’s disease.</p>

  <h3 id="asbestos.">Asbestos.</h3>

  <p>On the other hand, how difficult it must have been with the limited scientific knowledge of that time to distinguish true from false marvelous properties may be inferred from Plutarch’s description <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup> of a certain soft and pliable stone that used to be produced at Carystus and from which handkerchiefs and hairnets were made which could not be burnt and were cleaned by exposure to fire, - a description, it would seem, of our asbestos, although Plutarch does not give the stone any name.</p>

  <p>Strabo also ascribes similar properties to a stone from Carystus without naming it. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup></p>

  <p>Dioscorides and other Greek authors, we are told <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">57</a></sup> apply the word “asbestos” to quick-lime,</p>

  <p>but Pliny in the Natural History <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup> describes what he says the Greeks call ‘αμίαντο, αμίαντος, άσβεστος’ much as Plutarch does.</p>

  <p>He adds that it is employed in making shrouds for royal funerals to separate the ashes of the corpse from those of the pyre. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup> But he seems to regard it as a plant, not a stone, listing it as a variety of linen in one of his books on vegetation.</p>

  <p>He also states incorrectly that it is found but rarely and in desert and arid regions of India where there is no rain and a hot sun and amid terrible serpents. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup></p>

  <p>Probably Pliny or his source argued that anything which resisted the action of fire must have been inured by growth under fiery suns and among serpents.<br/> Furthermore it obviously should possess other marvelous properties, so we are not surprised to find Anaxilaus cited to the effect that if this “linen” is tied around a tree trunk, the blows with which the tree is felled cannot be heard. It was thus that imaginations inured to magic enlarged upon unusual natural properties.</p>

  <h3 id="on-rivers-and-mountains.">On Rivers and Mountains.</h3>

  <p>A treatise upon rivers and mountains in which the mar- velous virtues of herbs and stones figure very prominently has sometimes been included among the works of Plutarch, but also has been omitted entirely from some editions. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup></p>

  <p>Some have ascribed it to Parthenius of the time of Nero. It is made up of some thirty-five chapters in each of which a river and a mountain are mentioned. Usually some myth or tragic history is recounted, from which the river took its name or with which it was otherwise intimately connected. A similar procedure is followed in the case of the mountain. The writer, whoever he may be, makes a show of extensive reading, citing over forty authorities, most of whom are Greek and not mentioned in the full bibliographies of Pliny’s Natural History. The titles cited have to do largely with stones, rivers, and different countries. It has been questioned, however, whether these citations are not bogus. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="magic-herbs.">Magic herbs.</h3>

  <p>The properties attributed to herbs and stones in thistreatise are to a large extent magical. A white reed found in the river Phasis while one is sacrificing at dawn to Hecate, if strewn in a wife’s bedroom, drives mad any adulterer who enters and makes him confess his sin. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup></p>

  <p>Another herb mentioned in the same chapter was used by Medea to protect Jason from her father. In a later chapter <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup> we are told how Hera called upon Selene to aid her in securing her revenge upon Heracles, and how the moon goddess filled a large chest with froth and foam by her magic spells until presently a huge lion leaped out of the chest.</p>

  <p>Returning from such sorceresses as Hecate, Medea, and Selene to herbs alone, in other rivers are plants which test the purity of gold, aid dim sight or blind one, wither at the mention of the word “step-mother” or burst into flames whenever a step-mother has evil designs against her step-son, free their bearers from fear of apparitions, operate as charms in love-making and childbirth, cure madmen of their frenzy, check quartan agues if applied to the breasts, protect virginity or wither at a virgin’s touch, turn wine into water except that it retains its bouquet, or preserve persons anointed with their juice from sickness to their dying day.</p>

  <h3 id="stones-found-in-plants-and-fish.">Stones found in plants and fish.</h3>

  <p>An easy transition from the theme of magic herbs to that of stones is afforded by a sort of poppy which grows river of Mysia and bears black, harp-shaped stones which the natives gather and scatter over their ploughed fields. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">65</a></sup></p>

  <p>If these stones then lie still where they have fallen, it is taken as a sign of a barren year; but if they fly away like locusts, this prognosticates a plentiful harvest. Other mar- velous stones are found in the head of a fish in the river Arar, a tributary of the Rhone. The fish is itself quite wonderful since it is white while the moon waxes and black when it wanes. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">66</a></sup></p>

  <p>Presumably for this reason the stone cures quartan agues, if applied to the left side of the body while the moon is waning. There is another stone which must be sought after under a waxing moon with pipers playing continually. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">67</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="virtues-of-other-stones.">Virtues of other stones.</h3>

  <p>Other stones guard treasuries by sounding a trumpet- stones, like alarm at the approach of thieves; or change color four times a day and are ordinarily visible only to young girls. But if a virgin of marriageable age chances to see this stone, she is safe from attempts upon her chastity henceforth. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">68</a></sup></p>

  <p>Some stones drive men mad and are connected with the Mother of the Gods or are found only during the celebration of the mysteries. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">69</a></sup></p>

  <p>Others stop dogs from barking, expel demons, grow black in the hands of false witnesses, protect from wild beasts, and have varied medicinal powers or other effects similar to those already mentioned in the case of herbs. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70">70</a></sup></p>

  <p>In a river where the Spartans were defeated is a stone which leaps towards the bank, if it hears a trumpet, but sinks at the mention of the Athenians. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71">71</a></sup> Certainly a marvelous stone, capable of both hearing and motion !</p>

  <h3 id="fascination.">Fascination.</h3>

  <p>Leaving the treatise on rivers and mountains, for the occult virtue of human beings we may turn to a discussion of fascination in the <em>Symposiacs</em>. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72">72</a></sup></p>

  <p>Some of the company ridiculed the idea, but their host asserted that a myriad of events went to prove it and that if you reject a thing simply because you cannot give a reason for it, you</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“take away the marvelous from all things.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He pointed out that some men hurt little and tender children by looking at them, and argued that, as the plumes of other birds are ruined when mixed with those of the eagle, so men may injure by their touch or mere glance. Plutarch, who was of the company, suggested effluvia or emanations from the body as a possible explanation, pointing out that love begins with glances, that no disease is more contagious than sore eyes, and that gazing upon the curlew cures jaundice. The bird appears to attract the disease to itself, and averts its head and closes its eyes, not, as some think, because it is jealous of the remedy sought from it, but because it feels wounded as if from a blow. Others of the company contended that the passions and affections of the soul may have a powerful effect through the eyes and glance upon other persons, and argued that the sufferings of the soul strengthen the powers of the body, and that the same counter-charms are efficacious against envy as against fascination.<br/> The emanations which Democritus believed that envious and malicious persons sent forth are also mentioned; fathers have fascinated their own children, and it is even possible that one might injure oneself by reflection of one’s gaze. It is suggested that young children may sometimes be fascinated in this manner rather than by the glance of others.</p>

  <h3 id="animal-sagacity-and-remedies.">Animal sagacity and remedies.</h3>

  <p>Plutarch devotes two essays to the familiar theme of the Animal craftiness and sagacity of animals and the remedies used by them. In one essay <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73">73</a></sup> a companion of Odysseus refuses to allow Circe to turn him back from a pig to human form.</p>

  <p>He boasts among other things that beasts know how to cure themselves. Without ever having been taught swine when sick run to rivers to search for craw-fish; tortoises physic themselves with origanum after eating vipers; and Cretan goats devour dittany to extract arrows and darts which have been shot into their bodies. In the other essay <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74">74</a></sup> on the cleverness of animals we find many familiar stories repeated, including some of the inevitable excerpts from Juba on elephants.</p>

  <p>We meet again the dolphins with their love for mankind, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75">75</a></sup></p>

  <p>the bird who picks the crocodile’s teeth and warns him of the ichneumon, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76">76</a></sup></p>

  <p>the fish who rescue one another by biting the line or dragging one another by the tail out of nets, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77">77</a></sup></p>

  <p>the trained elephant who was slow to learn and was beaten for it and was afterwards seen practicing his exercises by himself in the moonlight, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78">78</a></sup></p>

  <p>the sentinel cranes who stand on one foot and hold a stone in the other to awaken them if they let it drop. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79">79</a></sup></p>

  <p>More novel perhaps is the story how herons open oysters by first swallowing them, shells and all, until they are relaxed by the internal heat of the bird, which then vomits them up and eats them out of the shells. Or the account of the tunny fish who needs no astrological canons and is familiar with arithmetic,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Yes, by Zeus, and with optics, too.” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80">80</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3 id="theories-and-queries-about-nature">Theories and queries about nature</h3>

  <p>Plutarch’s essays bring out yet other interests and de- fects of the science of the time. One on <em>The Principle of Cold</em> is a good illustration of the failings of the ancient hypothesis of four elements and four qualities and of the silly, limited arguing which usually and almost of necessity accompanied it. He denies that cold is mere privation of heat, since it seems to act positively upon fluids and solids and exists in different degrees. After considering various assertions such as that air becomes cold when it becomes dark; that air whitens things and water blackens them; that cold objects are always heavy; he finally associates the element earth especially with the quality cold.<br/> In another essay <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81">81</a></sup> he states that there are no females of a certain type of beetle which was engraved as a charm upon the rings warriors wore to battle, but that the males begat offspring by rolling up balls of earth.</p>

  <p>He declares that</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“diseases do not have distinct germs” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82">82</a></sup></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>in a discussion in the Symposiacs whether there can be new diseases.<br/> Other natural questions discussed in the treatise of that name and the <em>Symposiacs</em> are:<br/> Why a man who often passes near dewy trees contracts leprosy in those limbs which touch the wood?<br/> Why the Dorians pray for bad hay-making?<br/> Why bears’ paws are the sweetest and most palatable food?<br/> Why the tracks of wild beasts smell worse at the full of the moon? Why bees are more apt to sting fornicators than other persons? <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83">83</a></sup></p>

  <p>Why the flesh of sheep bitten by wolves is sweeter than that of other sheep?<br/> Why mushrooms are thought to be produced by thunder?<br/> Why flesh decays sooner in moonlight than sunlight?<br/> Whether Jews abstain from pork because they worship the pig or because they have an antipathy towards it? <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn84" id="fnref84">84</a></sup></p>

  <h3 id="the-antipodes.">The Antipodes.</h3>

  <p>Plutarch sometimes shows evidence of considerable astronomical knowledge. For instance, he knows that the mathematicians figure that the distance from sun to earth is immense, and that Aristarchus demonstrated the sun to be eighteen or twenty times as far off as the moon, which is distant fifty-six times the earth’s radius at the lowest estimate. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85">85</a></sup></p>

  <p>Yet in the same essay <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86">86</a></sup> Plutarch has scoffed at the idea of a spherical earth and of antipodes, and at the asser- tion that bars weighing a thousand talents would stop falling at the earth’s center, if a hole were opened up through the earth, or that two men with their feet in opposite directions at the center of the earth might nevertheless both be right side up, or that one man whose middle was at the center might be half right side up and half upside down.</p>

  <p>He admits, however, that the philosophers think so. Thus we see that Christian fathers like Lactantius were not the first to ridicule the notion of the Antipodes; apparently as well educated and omnivorous a pagan reader as Plutarch could do the same.<code>enter code here</code></p>

      <li id="fn57" class="footnote-item"><p>Article on “Asbestos” in the_Encyclopedia Britannica_, 11th edition, which further states that Charlemagne was said to own a tablecloth which was cleaned by throwing it into the fire, and that in 1676 a merchant from China exhibited to the Royal Society a handkerchief of ‘“salamander’s wool” or linum asbesti (asbestos linen).

      <li id="fn58" class="footnote-item"><p>X1X, 4. In Bostock and Riley’s English translation, note 44 states that “the wicks of the inextinguishable lamps of the middle ages, the existence of which was an article of general belief, were said to be made of asbestus.” On its use in lamp-wicks see also Pausanias, I, 26, 7. <a href="#fnref58" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li>

      <li id="fn59" class="footnote-item"><p>“In the year 1702 there was found near the Naevian Gate at Rome a funeral urn, in which there was a skull, calcined bones, and other ashes, enclosed in a cloth of asbestus of a marvelous length. It is still preserved in theVatican", (Bostock and Riley, note 45). <a href="#fnref59" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li>

The article on “Amiantus (3)” in Pauly- Wissowa incorrectly assumes that in XIX, 4, Pliny has it in mind. In XXXVI, 31, however, Pliny briefly describes the stone amianthus, which Bostock and Riley (note 52) call “the most delicate variety of asbestus, as “losing nothing in fire” and “resisting all potions (or, spells) even of the magi,” - “Amiantus alumini similis nihil igni deperdit. Hic veneficis resistit omnibus privatim magorum.” In XXXVII, 54, in an alphabetical list of stones, he briefly states that asbestos is iron-colored and found in the mountains of Arcadia,— “Asbestos in Arcadiae montibus nascitur coloris ferrei.” <a href="#fnref60" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li>
