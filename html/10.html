<h3 id="mystic-works-of-revelation">Mystic works of revelation</h3>
<p>There were in circulation in the Roman Empire many writings which purported to be of divine origin and authorship,  or at least the work of ancient culture-heroes and founders of religions who were of divine descent and divinely inspired. These oracular and mystic compositions usually pretend to great antiquity and often claim as their home such hoary lands as Egypt and Chaldea, although in the Hellenic past Apollo and in the Roman past the Sibylline books <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> also afford convenient centers about which forgeries cluster.</p>
<p>Assuming as these writings do to disclose the secrets of ancient priesthoods and to publish what should not be revealed to the vulgar crowd, they may be confidently expected to embody a great deal of superstition and magic along with their expositions of mystic theologies. Also the authors, editors, or publishers of astrological, alchemistic, and other pseudo-scientific treatises could not be expected to resist the temptation of claiming a venerable and cryptic origin for some of their books. Moreover, such pseudo- literature was not entirely unjustified in its affirmation of high antiquity. Few things in intellectual history antedate magic, and these spurious compositions are not especially distinguished by new ideas, although they to some extent reflect the progress made in learning, occult as well as scientific, in the Hellenistic age. It must be added that much of their contents depends for its effect entirely upon its claim to eminent authorship and great antiquity and upon the impressionability of its public. To-day most of it seems trivial commonplace or marked by the empty vagueness characteristic of oracular utterances. I shall attempt no complete exposition or exhaustive treatment of such writings <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> but touch upon a few examples which bear upon the relations of science and magic.</p>
<h2 id="hermes">Hermes</h2>
<h3 id="the-hermetic-books.">The Hermetic books.</h3>
<p>Chief among these are the Hermetic books or writings attributed to Hermes the Egyptian or Trismegistus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Under this name,” wrote Steinschneider in 1906, “there exists in many languages a literature, for the most part superstitious, which seems to have not yet been treated in its totality.” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Egyptian god Thoth or Tehuti, known in Greek as Θωύθ, Θώθ,  Τάτ - Thoýth, Thóth, Tát - Soth, Thoth, Tath, was identified with Hermes, and the epithet “thrice-great” is also derived from the Egyptian aã aã, “the great Great.” Citations of works ascribed to this Hermes Trismegistus can be traced back as early as the first century of our era.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>He is also mentioned or quoted by various church fathers from Athenagoras to Augustine and often figures in the magical papyri. The historian Ammianus Marcellinus <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> in the fourth century ranks him with the great sages of the past such as Pythagoras, Socrates, and Apollonius of Tyana.</p>
<p>Our two chief descriptions of the Hermetic books from the period of the Roman Empire are found in the <em>Stromata</em> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup> of the Christian Clement of Alexandria (c.150-c.220 A.D.)</p>
<p>and in the <em>De mysteriis</em> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup> ascribed to the Neo-Platonist lamblichus (died about 330 A.D.).</p>
<p>Clement speaks of forty-two books by Hermes which are regarded as “indispensable.” Of these ten are called “Hieratic” and deal with the laws, the gods, and the training of the priests. Ten others detail the sacrifices, prayers, processions, festivals, and other rites of Egyptian worship. Two contain hymns to the gods and rules for the king. Six are medical,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“treating of the structure of the body and of diseases and instruments and medicines and about the eyes and the last about women.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four are astronomical or astrological, and the remaining ten deal with cosmography and geography or with the equipment of the priests and the paraphernalia of the sacred rites. Clement does not say so, but from his brief summary one can imagine how full these volumes probably were of occult virtues of natural substances, of magical procedure, and of intimate relations and interactions between nature, stars, and spirits. lamblichus repeats the statement of Seleucus that Hermes wrote twenty thousand volumes and the assertion of Manetho that there were 36,525 books, a number doubtless connected with the supposed length of the year, three hundred and sixty-five and one-quarter days. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>lamblichus adds that Hermes wrote one hundred treatises on the ethereal gods and one thousand concerning the celestial gods. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>He is aware, however, that most books attributed to Hermes were not really composed by him, since in other passages he speaks of “the books which are circulated under the name of Hermes,” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>and explains that “our ancestors . , . inscribed all their own writings with the name of Hermes,” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup> thus dedicating them to him as the patron deity of language and theology. By the time of lamblichus these books had been translated from the Egyptian tongue into Greek.</p>
<h3 id="poimandres-and-the-hermetic-corpus."><em>Poimandres</em> and the <em>Hermetic <em>Corpus</em></em>.</h3>
<p>There has come down to us under the name of Hermes a collection of seventeen or eighteen fragments which is generally known as the <em>Hermetic <em>Corpus</em></em>. Of the fragments the first and chief is entitled <em>Poimandres</em> {HoLnavbp-qs), a name which is sometimes apphed to the entire <em>Corpus</em>. Another fragment entitled Asclepius, since it is in the form of a dialogue between him and “Mercurius Trismegistus,” exists in a Latin form which has been ascribed probably incorrectly to Apuleius of Madaura as translator (<em>Asclepius . . . Mercurii trismegisti dialogus Lucio Apuleio Madau- rensi philosopho Platonico interprete</em>) . None of the Greek manuscripts of the <em>Corpus</em> seems older than the fourteenth century, although Reitzenstein thinks that they may all be derived from the version which Michael Psellus had before him in the eleventh century. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>But the concluding prayer of the <em>Poimandres</em> exists in a third century papyrus, and the alchemist Zosimus in the fourth century seems acquainted with the entire collection. The treatises in this <em>Corpus</em> are concerned primarily with religious philosophy or theosophy, with doctrines similar to those of Plato concerning the soul and to the teachings of the Gnostics, The moral and religious instruction is associated, however, with a physics and cosmology very favorable to astrology and magic. Of magic in the narrow sense there is little in the <em>Corpus</em>, but a Hermetic fragment preserved by Stobaeus affirms that “philosophy and magic nourish the soul.” Astrology plays a much more prominent part, and the stars are ranked as visible gods, of whom the sun is by far the greatest. All seven planets nevertheless control the changes in the world of nature; there are seven human types corresponding to them; and the twelve signs of the zodiac also govern the human body. Only the chosen few who possess gnosis or are capable of receiving nous can escape the decrees of fate as administered by the stars and ultimately return to the spiritual world, passing through “choruses of demons” and “courses of stars” and reaching the Ogdoad or eighth heaven above and beyond the spheres of the seven planets. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Such Gnostic cosmology and demonology, especially the location of demons amid the planetary spheres, provides favorable ground for the development of astrological necromancy.</p>
<h3 id="astrological-treatises-ascribed-to-hermes.">Astrological treatises ascribed to Hermes.</h3>
<p>Not only is a belief in astrology implied throughout the_Poimandres_, but a number of separate astrological treatises are extant in whole or part under the name of Hermes Trismegistus [6:1]</p>
<p>[^6:1] Consult the bibliography in Kroll’s article in Pauly-Wissowa.</p>
<p>and he is frequently cited as an authority in other Greek astrological manuscripts. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>The treatises attributed to him comprise one upon general method, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>one on the names and powers of the twelve signs, one on astrological medicine addressed to Ammon the Egyptian,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>one on thunder and lightning, and some hexameters on the relation of earth- quakes to the signs of the zodiac. This last is also ascribed to Orpheus. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>There are various allusions to and versions of tracts concerning the relation of herbs to the planets or signs of the zodiac or thirty-six decans. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>  These treatises attribute magic virtues to plants, include a prayer to be repeated when plucking each herb, and tell how to use the astrological figures of the decans, engraved on stones, as healing amulets.</p>
<h3 id="hermetic-works-of-alchemy.">Hermetic works of alchemy.</h3>
<p>Works under the name of Hermes Trismegistus are cited by Greek alchemists of the closing Roman Empire, such as Zosimus, Stephanus, and Olympiodorus, but those Hermetic treatises of alchemy which are extant are of late date and much altered. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Some treatises are preserved only in Arabic; others are medieval Latin fabrications. The Greek alchemists, however, seem to have recited the mystic hymn of Hermes from the <em>Poimandres</em>. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="nechepso-and-petosiris">Nechepso and Petosiris</h3>
<p>Hellenistic and Roman astrology sought to extend its roots far back into Egyptian antiquity by putting forth spurious treatises under the names, not only of Hermes Trismegistus, but also of Nechepso and Petosiris, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup> who were regarded respectively as an Egyptian king and an Egyptian priest who had lived at least seven centuries before Christ.</p>
<p>Indeed, they were held to be the recipients of divine revelation from Hermes and Asclepius. A lengthy astrological treatise, which Pliny <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>is the first to cite and from a fourteenth book of which Galen <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup> mentions a magic ring of jasper engraved with a dragon and rays, seems to have appeared in their names probably at Alexandria in the Hellenistic period.</p>
<p>Only fragments and citations ascribed to Nechepso and Petosiris are now extant. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="manetho">Manetho</h2>
<p>Yet another astrological work which claims to be drawn from the secret sacred books and cryptic monuments of ancient Egypt is ascribed to Manetho. It is a compilation in verse of prognostications from the various constellations and is regarded as the work of several writers, of whom the oldest is placed in the reign of Alexander Severus in the third century.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="orpheus.">Orpheus.</h2>
<h3 id="the-lithica-of-orpheus.">The <em>Lithica</em> of Orpheus.</h3>
<p>Orpheus is another author more cited than preserved by The classical antiquity. Pliny called him the first writer on herbs Orpheus, and suspected him of magic. Ernest Riess affirms that Rohde (<em>Psyche</em>, p. 398)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“has abundantly proved that Orpheus’ followers were among the chief promulgators of purification and charms against evil spirits.” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among poems of some length extant under Orpheus’ name the one of most interest to us is the <em>Lithica</em>, where in 770 lines the virtues of some thirty gems are set forth with considerable allusion to magic. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>The authorship is uncertain, but the verse is supposed to follow the prose treatise by Damigeron who lived in the second century B. C. The date of the poem is now generally fixed in the fourth century of our era, although King <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup> argued for an earlier date. I agree with him that the allusion in lines 71-74 to decapitation on the charge of magic is, taken alone, too vague and blind to be associated with any particular event or time; editors since Tyrwhitt have connected it with the law of Constantius against magic and the persecution of magicians in 371 A. D. But King’s contention that the <em>Lithica</em> is by the same author as the Argonaiitica, also ascribed to Orpheus, and is therefore of early date, falls to the ground since the Argonaiitica, too, is now dated in the fourth century.</p>
<h3 id="argument-of-the-poem">Argument of the poem</h3>
<p>The <em>Lithica</em> opens by representing Hermes as bestowing upon mankind the precious lore of the marvelous virtues of gems. In his cave are stored stones which banish ghosts, robbers, and snakes, which bring health, happiness, victory in war and games, honor at courts and success in love, and which insure safety on journeys, the favor of the gods, and enable one to read the hidden thoughts of others and to understand the language of the birds as they predict the future. Few persons, however, avail themselves of this mystic lore, and those who do so are liable to be executed on the charge of magic. After this introduction, which may be regarded as a piquant appetizer to whet the reader’s taste for further details, the virtues of individual stones are described, first in the words of Theodamas, a wise and divine man  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup> whom the author meets on his way to perform annual sacrifice at an altar of the Sun, where as a child he narrowly escaped from a deadly snake, and then in a speech of the seer Helenus to Philoctetes which Theodamas quotes. Greek gods are often mentioned; as the poem proceeds the virtues of a number of gems are attributed to Apollo rather than Hermes; and there are allusions to Greek mythology and the Trojan war. Some gems are found in animals, for instance, in the viper or the brain of the stag.</p>
<h3 id="magic-powers-of-stones.">Magic powers of stones.</h3>
<p>Let us turn to some examples of the marvelous virtues of particular stones. The crystal wins favorable answers from the gods to prayers; kindles fire, if held over sticks, yet itself remains cold; as a ligature benefits kidney trouble.<br>
Sacrifices in which the adamant is employed win the favor of the gods; it is also called Lethaean because it makes one forget worries, or the milk-stone (galactis) because it renews the milk of sheep or goats when powdered in brine and sprinkled over them. Worn as an amulet it counteracts the evil eye and gains royal favor for its bearer.<br>
The agate is an agricultural amulet and should be attached to the plowman’s arm and the horns of the oxen. Other stones help vineyards, bring rain or avert hail and pests from the crops.<br>
Lychnis prevents a pot from boiling on a fire and makes it boil when the fire is dead.<br>
The magnet was used by the witches Circe and Medea in their spells; an unchaste wife is unable to remain in the bed where this stone has been placed with an incantation.<br>
Other stones cure snake-bite and various diseases, serve as love-charms or aids in child- birth, or counteract incantations and enchantments.</p>
<h3 id="magic-rites-to-gain-powers-of-divination.">Magic rites to gain powers of divination.</h3>
<p>To make the gem <em>sideritis</em> or oreites utter vocal oracles the operator must abstain for three weeks from animal food, the public baths, and the marriage bed; he is then to wash and clothe the gem like an infant and employ various sacrifices, incantations, and illuminations. The gem Liparaios, known to the learned Magi of Assyria, when burnt on a bloodless altar with hymns to the Sun and Earth attracts snakes from their holes to the flame. Three youths robed in white and carrying two-edged swords should cut up the snake who comes nearest the fire into nine pieces, three for the Sun, three for the earth, three for the wise and prophetic maiden. These pieces are then to be cooked with wine, salt, and spices and eaten by those who wish to learn the language of birds and beasts. But further the gods must be invoked by their secret names and libations poured of milk, wine, oil, and honey. What is not eaten must be buried, and the participants in the feast are then to return home wearing chaplets but otherwise naked and speaking to no one whom they may meet. On their arrival home they are to sacrifice mixed spices. It will be recalled that Apollonius of Tyana and the Arabs also learned the language of the birds by eating snake-flesh.</p>
<h3 id="power-of-gems-compared-with-herbs.">Power of gems compared with herbs.</h3>
<p>Thus gems are potent in religion and divination, love- Powers charms and child-birth, medicine and agriculture. The poem compared fails, however, to touch upon their uses in alchemy or relations to the stars, nor does it contain much of anything that can be called necromancy. But the author ranks the virtues of stones above those of herbs, whose powers disappear with age. Moreover, some plants are injurious, whereas the marvelous virtues of stones are almost all beneficial as well as permanent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is great force in herbs,” he says, “but far greater in stones,”  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>an observation often repeated in the middle ages.</p>
<h3 id="magic-herbs-and-demons-in-orphic-rites.">Magic herbs and demons in Orphic rites.</h3>
<p>More stress is laid upon the power of demons and herbs in a description which has been left us by Saint Cyprian, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup> bishop of Antioch in the third century, of some pagan mysteries upon Mount Olympus into which he was initiated when a boy of fifteen and which have been explained as Orphic rites. His initiation was under the charge of seven hierophants, lasted for forty days, and included instruction in the virtues of magic herbs and visions of the operations of demons. He was also taught the meaning of musical notes and harmonies, and saw how times and seasons were governed by good and evil spirits. In short, magic, pseudo- science, occult virtue, and perhaps astrology formed an important part of Orphic lore.</p>
<h2 id="zooraster.">Zooraster.</h2>
<h3 id="books-ascribed-to-zoroaster.">Books ascribed to <em>Zoroaster</em>.</h3>
<p>Cumont states in his <em>Oriental Religions</em> in <em>Roman Paganism</em> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“towards the end of the Alexandrine period the books ascribed to the half -mythical masters of the Persian science, <em>Zoroaster</em>, Hosthanes and Hystaspes, were translated into Greek, and until the end of paganism those names enjoyed a prodigious authority.”  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pliny regarded <em>Zoroaster</em> as the founder of magic and we have met other examples of his reputation as a magician. Later we shall find him cited several times in the Byzantine Geoponica which seems to use a book ascribed to him on the sympathy and antipathy existing between natural objects.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>Naturally a number of pseudo-Zoroastrian books were in circulation, some of which Porphyry, the Neo- Platonist, is said to have suppressed. At least he tells us in his <em>Life of Plotinus</em>  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup> that certain Christians and other men claimed to possess certain revelations of <em>Zoroaster</em>, but that he advanced many arguments to show that their book was not written by <em>Zoroaster</em> but was a recent composition.</p>
<h3 id="the-chaldean-oracles.">The Chaldean Oracles.</h3>
<p>There has been preserved, however, in the writings of the Neo-Platonists a collection of passages known as the  Zoroastrian Logia or Chaldean Oracles  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup> and which</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“present … a heterogeneous mass, now obscure and again bombastic, of commingled Platonic, Pythagorean, Stoic, Gnostic, and Persian tenets.”  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only are these often cited by the Neo-Platonists, but Porphyry, lamblichus, and Proclus composed commentaries upon them.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>Some think that these citations and commentaries have reference to a single work put together by Julian the Chaldean in the period of the Antonines. This “mass of oriental superstitions, a medley of magic, theurgy, and delirious metaphysics,”  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup> was reverenced by the Neo-Platonists of the following centuries as a sacred authority equal to the <em>Timaeus</em> of Plato. Our next chapter will therefore deal with the writings of the Neo-Platonists upon whom this spurious mystic literature had so much influence.</p>
