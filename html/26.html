<h3 id="general-character.">General character.</h3>
<p>A class of writings which seems to have been very characteristic of the waning culture of the declining Roman Empire and the scanty erudition of the early medieval period were the brief epitomes of, or disorderly collections of fragments from, the writers of the classical period. Such works often passed under the name of some famous author of the previous period and sometimes are more or less based upon his writings. Most of the works in the field of natural science are of such derivative or pseudo-authorship: the Medicine of the Pseudo-Pliny, the Herbarium of the Pseudo-Apuleius, the geographical work ascribed to Aethicus, the <em>Geoponica</em>, the treatises on herbs attributed to Macer and Dioscorides. Indeed, the whole textual history of the latter’s <em>De materia medica</em> is so full of vicissitudes and uncertainties that I have postponed its treatment until this chapter. The names of the actual compilers or abbreviators of these works are usually unknown and it is also usually impossible to date them with any approach to accuracy.<br>
Roughly speaking of them as a whole, they may be said to have gradually taken on their present form at almost any time between the third and tenth centuries. In the case of these works of natural science at least, it is not quite fair to class them all as brief epitomes or disorderly collections. In some we see an obvious attempt to rearrange the old materials in a form more convenient for present use. In others to the stage of abbreviation from ancient authors has succeeded another stage of later additions from other sources.</p>
<h3 id="medicine-of-pliny"><em>Medicine of Pliny</em></h3>
<p>The <em>Medicina</em>, or <em>Art of Medicine</em>, of the Pseudo-Pliny  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> consists of three books in which medical passages, drawn from Pliny’s Natural History, are rearranged according to diseases instead of, as in the genuine Pliny, by simples. The first two books deal with diseases of the human body in descending order from top to toe and from headache to gout, a favorite arrangement throughout the course of medieval medicine. The last book then considers afflictions which are not necessarily connected with any particular part of the body, such as wounds and fevers. Thus this compilation attests Pliny’s medieval influence and the practical use made of his work, while it of course continues much of his medical magic and superstition. The compiler’s rearrangement is an essential one, if the medical recommendations of the Natural History were to be made available for ready reference. In this case, therefore, the epitomizer has rather improved upon than disordered the arrangement of the original.</p>
<p>This compilation is believed to have been used by Marcellus Empiricus, and a Letter of Pliniiis Secundus to his friends about medicine, which Marcellus gives along with other medical epistles, is thought to be the preface of the abbreviator, who in that case depicts himself as composing his volume so that his friends and himself when traveling may avoid the payment of exorbitant fees asked by strange physicians. If we can regard everything in the work of Marcellus as we have it as having been written by 400, the <em>Medicine of Pliny</em> must have been written during the declining Roman Empire. The manuscripts used by Rose in his edition were of the tenth and twelfth centuries. There is also a later version of the <em>Medicine of Pliny</em> in five books  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> of which the two last are entirely new additions, the fifth being an extract from the old Latin translation of Alexander of Tralles. And in the first three books the earlier Pseudo-Pliny has been worked over with additions.</p>
<p>The Pseudo-Pliny is also embodied with alterations and accompanied by some prayers and incantations in a tenth century manuscript at St. Gall.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="herbarium-of-apuleius"><em>Herbarium</em> of Apuleius</h2>
<p>Several works besides the six commonly regarded as genuine  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup> were attributed to Apuleius in the middle ages,</p>
<p>grammatical  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>and rhetorical  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>treatises, the Hermetic <em>Asclepius</em>,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>a treatise on physiognomy,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>and the very widespread <em>Sphere of Life and Death</em> , of which we shall treat in another chapter.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>We shall now consider the <em>Herbarium of Apuleius</em>,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup> the one of his spurious works, which has most to do with the world of nature, and, with the exception of the brief Sphere, the one which occurs most often in the manuscripts.</p>
<p>The <em>Herbarium</em> was first printed about 1480 by the physician of Pope Sixtus IV from a manuscript at Monte Cassino, and then, after various other editions, was included in 1547 in the collection of ancient Latin medical writers issued by the Aldine Press. We are told, however, that with the close of the fifteenth century the Apuleius began to be superseded by German herbals. The medieval manuscripts of the Herharimn are often noteworthy for their illuminations of the herbs in vivid colors. Those of the mandragora root are especially interesting, showing it as a man standing on the back of a dog or a human form with leaves growing on the head and led by a dog chained to his waist,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The oldest manuscripts are of the sixth century, and there are some in Anglo-Saxon, but as one would expect, the work underwent many additions and alterations, and different manuscripts of it vary considerably. The author is usually spoken of as Apuleius the Platonist and is sometimes said to have received his work from the centaur Chiron, the master of Achilles, and from Esculapius.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="specimens-of-its-occult-science.">Specimens of its occult science.</h3>
<p>In the <em>Herbarium</em> the plants are listed and described Specimens and their virtues, especially medicinal, stated. Usually the occult names for each herb in several languages or regions are science, given - Latin, Greek, Punic, Biblical (by the Prophets), Egyptian, Syrian, Gallic, Dacian, Spanish, Phrygian, Tuscan. By no means all of these are listed in every case, however. The virtues of the herbs, often operate in an occult manner, or procedure suggestive of magic is involved in collecting or applying them. Often diseases are cured merely by holding an herb in the hand, wearing it with a string about the neck, or placing it behind one ear, or wearing it in a ring. Lunatics, for example, are treated by binding an herb about the neck with red cloth when the moon is waxing in the sign of the bull or the first part of the scorpion.<br>
Not only does observance of astrology assist the medicinal application of herbs; plants are in turn of assistance in the pursuit of astrology. To learn under the rule of what star you are, be in a state of purity, pluck the herb Montaster, keep it in a bit of clean linen until you find a whole grain of wheat in a loaf of bread, then place this with the herb under your pillow and pray to the seven planets to reveal your guardian star to you in your sleep. Indeed prayers and incantations are frequently employed and in one case must be repeated nine times. Sometimes the herb itself is addressed, as in the conjuration,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Herb Erystion, I implore you to aid me and cheerfully afford me all your virtues and cure and make whole all those ills which Aesculapius and Chiron the centaur, masters of medicine, healed by means of you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the earth is conjured as in the prayer beginning, “Holy goddess Earth.” Such prayers are scarcely consonant with Christianity and in some manuscripts have been omitted and replaced by the Lord’s Prayer or other Christian forms, or left in with their wording shghtly ahered to avoid paganism.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Personal purity and clean clothing are often enjoined upon those gathering the herbs and such instructions are added as to mark the circle about the plant with gold, silver, ivory, the tooth of a wild boar, and the horn of a bull, or to fill the hole with honeyed fruits. Some herbs protect their bearers from all serpents or even from all evils. Others, like asparagus if you use a dry root of it to sprinkle the patient with spring water, break the spell of witchcraft. Asparagus is also beneficial for toothache and wonderfully relieves a tumor or bladder trouble, if it is boiled in water and drunk by the patient fasting for seven days and also used in bathing for a number of days. But one must be careful not to go out in the cold during this time nor to take cold drinks.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="a-precantation-of-all-herbs">A “Precantation of all herbs”</h3>
<p>In some manuscripts a “Precantation of all herbs” is placed at the beginning of the treatise.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup><br>
It prescribes such procedure as holding a mirror over the herb before plucking it before sunrise under a waning moon. The person plucking the herb and uttering the incantation must be barefoot, unguarded, chaste, and wear no ring. The plant is adjured not only “by the living God” and “the holy name of God, Sabaoth,” but also by Seia, the Roman goddess of sowing, and by “GS,” which presumably stands for Gaia Seia, an expression which is once written out in full. Some meaningless words are also repeated.</p>
<h3 id="other-treatises-accompanying-the-herbarium">Other treatises accompanying the <em>Herbarium</em></h3>
<p>The <em>Herbarium</em> is often accompanied in the manuscripts by other treatises on herbs ascribed to Dioscorides and Macer, of which we shall speak presently; by a work on the medicinal properties of animals, or more particularly of quadrupeds, by Sextus Papirius Placidus  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Actor  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>an otherwise quite unknown personage;  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>by a “letter concerning a little beast” from the king of Egypt or Aesculapius to the emperor Octavian Augustus;  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>and by introductory letters, such as we find prefaced to the <em>De medicamentis</em> of Marcellus Empiricus, of “Hippocrates to his Moecenas”  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup> and “Antonius Musus to Moecenas Agrippa.”</p>
<p>The epistle of the Egyptian king or Aesculapius to Augustus, however, really forms the introduction or opening chapter to the treatise of Sextus Papirius Placidus on the medicinal properties of animals, and after the little beast or quadruped called mela or taxo  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup> follow fast the stag, serpent, fox, hare, scorpion, and so forth.<br>
As for the taxo, Augustus is told that by means of it he can protect himself from sorcerers, avoid defections in his army, and preserve his troops from the pestilence which the barbarians bring, and the city of Rome from both pestilences and fires. To this end a lustration should be performed with its flesh, and it should then be buried at the city gates. One way to appropriate its virtue is to extract its large teeth, repeating a jargon of strange words the while.</p>
<h2 id="aethicus.">Aethicus.</h2>
<h3 id="cosmography.">Cosmography.</h3>
<p>Another characteristic product of declining antique learning and of early medieval effort is found in the field of geography in the Cosmography of Aethicus Istricus, translated into Latin by the priest Jerome (Hieronymus Presbyter). The oldest manuscript is one of the eighth century in the British Museum  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>where it is also found in several other fairly early manuscripts  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>in the respectable company of Vitruvius, Vegetius, Sallust, and Suetonius,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup> as well as with the more congenial work of Solinus.</p>
<p>This Cosmographia was not printed until 1852, when it was edited at Paris by M. d’Avezac and again in 1854 at Leipzig by M. H. Wuttke. It is an entirely different work from what had hitherto been repeatedly printed as the <em>Cosmography</em> of Aethicus but is really to be identified with fragments of Julian Honorius and Orosius. The Latin translator of our treatise had been identified in the middle ages with St. Jerome, the church father, and Wuttke still ascribed it to him, but Bunbury protested against this,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>and Mommsen placed our treatise not earlier than the seventh century.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="its-medieval-influence.">Its medieval influence.</h3>
<p>Bunbury added, however, that the <em>Cosmography</em> “appears to have been much read in the middle ages, and is therefore not without literary interest.” The apparent greatness of the names on the title page seems to have given the middle ages an exaggerated notion of the work’s importance. Aethicus himself is spoken of as from Istria and according to the Explicit of at least one manuscript  [^601:6] was a Scythian, but this does not mean that his attitude towards learning was that of a Hun, for the same Explicit goes on to inform us that he was of noble lineage and, if I correctly interpret the faulty syntax of its Latin, that from him the ethical philosophy of other sages drew its origins.<br>
Somewhat later Roger Bacon said in discussing faults in the study of theology in his day,</p>
<p>. [^601:6]: Harleian 3859.</p>
<p>“From the authorities of the philosophers whom the saints cite I shall abstain, except that I will strengthen the utterances of Ethicus the astronomer and Alchimus the philosopher by the authority of the blessed Jerome, since no one could credit that they had said so many marvelous things about Christ and the angels and demons and men who are to be glorified or damned unless Jerome or some other saint proved that they had said so.”  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="character-of-the-work.">Character of the work.</h3>
<p>As Bacon’s words indicate, Christian influence is manifest in the <em>Cosmography</em>, although, as they also indicate, the original Aethicus is not supposed to have been a Christian, but, as one manuscript informs us, an Academic philosopher.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup> Oriental influence, too, is perhaps shown in flights of poetical language and unrestrained imagination, in a number of allusions to Alexander the Great, and in an extraordinary ignorance of early Roman history which leads the author to tell how Romulus invaded Pannonia and fought against the Lacedaemonians. “How great carnage,” he exclaims, “in Lacedaemonia, Noricum and Pannonia, Istria and Albania, northern regions near my home, first at the hands of the Romans and the tyrant Numitor, then under the brothers Romulus and Remus, and later under the first Tarquin, the Proud.” The author eulogizes Athens as well as Alexander, and mentions a people called Turchi, but whether or not he has Turks in mind would be hard to say.</p>
<h3 id="its-attitude-to-marvels.">Its attitude to marvels.</h3>
<p>As we have it, the <em>Cosmography</em> cites both the Ethicus and the Alchimus to whom Roger Bacon referred. Indeed, our treatise does not pretend to be the original work of Aethicus, which it repeatedly cites, but is apparently the work of some epitomizer or abbreviator who intersperses remarks and comments of his own, and, according to one manuscript, makes the statements of Aethicus conform to Christian Scripture. From the volumes of the original work he makes only a few excerpts, professing to omit what is unheard of or unknown or seems too formidable, and including only with hesitancy a few bits concerning unknown races on the testimony of hearsay. The enigmas of Aethicus and other philosophers often give our abbreviator pause, and he regards as incredible the story of Aethicus that the Amazons nurse young minotaurs and centaurs who fight for them in return. Aethicus also tells of the wonderful armor of the Amazons which they treat with bitumen and the blood of their own offspring. In Crete Aethicus found herbs unknown in other lands which ward off famine. Very beautiful gems are mentioned, including those extracted from the brains of immense dragons and basilisks, but little is said of their virtues, occult or otherwise. Indeed, the amount either of specific information or specific misinformation in the book is very scanty. It deals largely in uncouth rhetoric, glittering generalities, and obscure allusion anent the wanderings of Aethicus over the face of the earth and the strange marvels which he encountered in distant lands. He is described as well versed in astrology and as reproving the astrologers of Scythia (?) and Mantua (?), and one passage vaguely speaks of the stars as signs of the present and future; but otherwise the abbreviator gives little evidence of knowledge of the subject, although Roger Bacon  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup> cited <em>Cosmography</em> in Cosmographia as one of his authorities when discussing the question of Jesus Christ’s nativity and its relation to the stars,</p>
<p>and although Pico della Mirandola ranked the <em>Cosmography</em> as one of the most absurd of astrological works.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>As for magic, in one passage malefici and magi are censured along with idolaters, and the author presently speaks of vain characters and superstitious doctrines. But elsewhere a magician (Pirronius magus) is named as the inventor of ships and discoverer of purple. On the whole, in its loose and hazy way the Cosmography not only is romantic and religious enough to appeal to medieval readers, it also is of a character to offer encouragement, if not data, to a later and more detailed interest in alchemy, occult virtues, astrology, and magic.</p>
<h3 id="the-geoponica.">The <em>Geoponica</em>.</h3>
<p>Upon the subject of agriculture in the early middle ages we have the collection known as the <em>Geoponica</em>. It properly belongs to Byzantine literature and perhaps had little direct influence upon western Europe. Nevertheless at least a por- tion of it upon vineyards was translated into Latin by Burgundio of Pisa in the twelfth century.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup> In any case as the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“only formal treatise on Greek agriculture”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>extant it is a rather important historical source; it also is a good specimen of early medieval compilations from classical works; and in its inclusion of superstitious and magical details it is probably roughly representative of the period, whether in east or west. In the form which we now possess it was published about 950 A. D. and dedicated to the Byzantine emperor, Constantine VII or Porphyrygennetos. But this issue was perhaps little more than an abbreviated revision of the work of Cassianus Bassus of the sixth century, whose introductory words to his son are still given at the beginning of the seventh book. Cassianus is believed in his turn to have been especially indebted to two fourth century writers, Vindanius Anatolius of Beirut, whose agricultural teaching was of a sober and rational sort, and Didymus of Alexandria, who was more given to superstition and magic.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="magic-and-astrology-therein.">Magic and astrology therein.</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, magic and astrology find no place in the index to the most recent edition of the work.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>A survey, however, of the text itself reveals some indications of the presence of both. The very first of its twenty books deals with astrological prediction of the weather and cites some spurious work or works by <em>Zoroaster</em> a great deal.<br>
In later books, too, <em>Zoroaster</em> is sometimes cited for semi-astrological advice, such as guarding wine jars against sun or moonbeams when opening them, or testing seed by exposing it to the rays of the dog-star.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Zoroaster</em> is also used as an authority on the sympathy and antipathy existing between natural objects.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>Damigeron and Democritus are other names cited which are suggestive of the occult and magical.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup></p>
<p>There are not, however, many cases of extreme superstition in the <em>Geoponica</em>. Something is said of the marvelous properties of gems, of the effect of a hyena’s shadow falling upon a dog by moonlight, and how dogs will not attack a person who holds a hyena’s tongue in his hand.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>Incantations of a sort are occasionally recommended.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>To keep wine from turning sour one is directed to write the divine words, “Taste and see that the Lord is good” upon the wine-jar.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>Another passage advises a person who finds himself in a place full of fleas to cry, “Ouch ! Ouch !” and then they will not bite him.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="dioscorides.">Dioscorides.</h2>
<p>Perhaps the chief ancient work on pharmacology was the <em>De materia medica</em> or Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς of Pedanius Dioscorides of Anazarba. Galen, as we have seen, found things to criticize in it but nevertheless made great use of it in his own work on medicinal simples. Dioscorides of course had his previous sources but seems to have surpassed them in fulness and orderliness of arrangement. Of the man himself his preface tells us all that we know, and his dedication shows that he probably wrote during the reign of Nero. He was born in Cilicia near Tarsus, he had traveled in many lands as a soldier, and his work was based partly upon personal observation and experience as well as previous books.</p>
<h3 id="textual-history-of-the-de-materia-medica.">Textual history of the <em>De materia medica</em>.</h3>
<p>Dioscorides’ influence continued and even increased as time went on; but if future centuries were deeply influenced by his book, it was also seriously affected by them, for it seems to have been subjected to a long series of repeated abbreviations and omissions, additions and interpolations, changes in form and in order. Thus all sorts of versions of what was called Dioscorides came into being, but which in some cases can hardly be regarded as more than compilations from all the favorite pharmacies of the time, in which the genuine Dioscorides constituted but a remnant or a core. Thus most early printed editions of what purports to be the <em>De materia medica</em> must be handled with great caution, and it may perhaps be doubted if even the latest effort of Max Wellmann to recover the original Greek text has been entirely successful.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>Of the five books regarded as genuine and original the first dealt with spices, salves, and oils; the second, with parts of animals and animal products like milk and honey, with grains, vegetables, and pot-herbs. Other plants and roots were considered in the third and fourth books, while the last dealt with wines and minerals.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="alterations-made-in-the-greek-text.">Alterations made in the Greek text.</h3>
<p>Whether we now possess Dioscorides’ original text or not, at any rate the oldest Greek manuscripts do not contain it, but only that portion dealing with herbs. Moreover, this has been rearranged in alphabetical order and has been adapted to fit a set of pictures of plants which were perhaps taken over from the work of Crateuas, one of Dioscorides’ chief sources. Such is the famous early sixth century illuminated manuscript made for Juliana Anicia, daughter of the emperor Olybrius (472 A. D.) and wife of the consul Areobindus (about 512 A. D.).  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>The alphabetical rearrangement of the Greek text of Dioscorides was made at some time between Galen and Oribasius, who cites from it in the fourth century. Not only were the five books of the genuine <em>De materia medica</em> interpolated, but additional spurious books were added “On Harmful Drugs” and “On Poisons.”  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup></p>
<p>The work on medicinal simples attributed to Dioscorides is extant in no manuscript earlier than the fourteenth century and some versions of it are much more interpolated than others. As Galen does not cite it while Oribasius and Aëtius  do use it, it is assumed that it was composed in the third or early fourth century with a forged dedication to a contemporary of Dioscorides, but that it made considerable use of the genuine Dioscorides, to which it bore much the same relation as the <em>Medicina Plinii</em> did to the <em>Historia Naturalis</em>. Later, however, some Byzantine compiler of the eleventh, twelfth, or thirteenth century introduced a great deal of new material from Galen’s genuine and spurious works in that field and from John of Damascus.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="dioscorides-little-known-to-latins-before-the-middle-ages.">Dioscorides little known to Latins before the middle ages.</h3>
<p>What more especially concern us are the medieval Latin versions of Dioscorides. As a matter of fact, although the <em>De materia medica</em> was from the start highly regarded and widely used by Greek physicians, it seems to have been little known to Latin writers until the verge of the medieval period. Gargilius Martialis, a Roman writer on agriculture in the third century of our era, was the only old Latin author to cite Dioscorides, which he did, however, no less than eighteen times in his Medicinae ex olerihiis et pomis. This has led to the suggestion that he was perhaps responsible for the first Latin translation or version of Dioscorides; but it seems unlikely that the work had been put into Latin as early as his time, since it is not cited again by a Latin writer until the sixth century and is not used by such medical authors as Serenus Sammonicus, Cassius Felix, Theodorus Priscianus, and Marcellus Empiricus.</p>
<h3 id="partial-versions-in-latin.">Partial versions in Latin.</h3>
<p>But at least a portion of Dioscorides seems to have been translated into Latin by the time of Cassiodorus, who, writ- ing in the first half of the sixth century, states that those who cannot read Greek may consult the <em>Herbarium Dioscoridis</em> .  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>This naturally suggests a version limited to medicinal plants like the early Greek text in the manuscript of Juliana Anicia. This impression is confirmed by the preface to some early Latin version of Dioscorides, which Rose discovered in one of the manuscripts of the <em>Herbarium</em> of Apuleius in the British Museum.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup> This preface implies that the translation which it introduced was limited to the botanical books of Dioscorides and states that it was accompanied by illustrations of herbs.</p>
<h3 id="de-herbis-femininis."><em>De herbis femininis</em>.</h3>
<p>Based upon this partial translation rather than identical with it is believed to have been the <em>De herbis femininis</em>,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup> which was ascribed to Dioscorides in the middle ages and which often accompanies the <em>Herbarium</em> of the Pseudo-Apuleius in the manuscripts.</p>
<p>In this case the herbs of the Pseudo-Apuleius are sometimes called masculine, but as a matter of fact only a minority of those in the Pseudo-Dioscorides seem to be distinctly feminine. Of seventy-one plants Kaestner classed fifteen or sixteen as feminine, while in only thirty cases are they prescribed for female com- plaints. Rose dated this work before Isidore of Seville by whom he believed it was used.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup> It seems to combine a free Latin translation of excerpts from the genuine Dioscorides with numerous additions from other sources.</p>
<h3 id="the-fuller-latin-versions.">The fuller Latin versions.</h3>
<p>Besides such abbreviated and interpolated Latin versions or perversions of Dioscorides, there was also in existence in the early middle ages a literal translation of all five books of the <em>De materia medica</em>. It is full of Latinisms and barbarisms but otherwise reproduces the complete and genuine Dioscorides, or is supposed to do so. Rose and Wellmann  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup> say that it was current from the sixth century on,</p>
<p>and the few extant manuscripts of it date from the early medieval period.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup></p>
<p>One reason for this seems to be that this literal translation was replaced by another Latin version which in a Bamberg manuscript  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup> is ascribed to Constantinus Africanus, the medical translator and writer of the eleventh century.</p>
<p>In this version the items are arranged alphabetically, and additions are embodied from other sources. This version apparently became much better known than the earlier literal translation and has been called</p>

<p>It is stated by Rose to be identical with the “Dyascorides,” upon which Peter of Abano lectured and commented about 1300 and which was printed at Colle in 1478 and again at Lyons in 1512.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="peter-of-abanos-account-of-the-medieval-versions.">Peter of Abano’s account of the medieval versions.</h3>
<p>Peter of Abano tells us in his preface  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup> that in his time there were current two different versions, although both had the same preface. One of these was in five books with a great many short chapters, so short in fact that often the treatment of a single thing was scattered over several chapters. This version was rare in Latin.</p>
<p>The other version contained fewer but longer chapters with material added from Galen, Pliny, and other writers. This version was arranged alphabetically. It was this version which <em>Aggregator</em>  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup> had followed and imitated, but sometimes there were chapters in either “Dyascorides” which were missing in <em>Aggregator</em>. Peter had also seen an alphabetical version of Dioscorides in Greek.</p>
<h3 id="pseudo-dioscorides-on-stones.">Pseudo-Dioscorides on stones.</h3>
<p>There seems also to have been current, at least in the later middle ages, a Pseudo-Dioscorides on stones, drawn in part, like the <em>Feminine Herbs</em>, from the genuine <em>De materia medica</em>, whose discussion of the virtues of stones is incredible enough.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>This <em>Dioscorides on Stones</em> is cited by Arnold of Saxony and Bartholomew of England in the thirteenth century, and portions at least of the work are extant in manuscripts at Erfurt and Montpellier.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup></p>
<p>A work on physical ligatures is ascribed to Dioscorides in a late manuscript,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup> but is really a collection of items from various authors since Dioscorides on the marvelous virtues of animals, herbs, and stones, especially when bound on the body, held in the hand, or worn around the neck.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions-from-the-textual-history-of-dioscorides.">Conclusions from the textual history of Dioscorides.</h3>
<p>The history of the medieval versions of Dioscorides, even in the brief and incomplete outline given here, is instructive, showing us in general the vicissitudes to which the transmission of the text of any ancient author may have been subjected, but more especially proving that the middle ages, whether Latin or Byzantine, were ready to take great liberties with ancient authorities and to adapt them to their own taste and requirements. And indeed, why should they not rearrange and make additions to their Dioscorides? After all it was a compilation to begin with.<br>
But the case of Dioscorides has also taught us that we do not have to wait until the medieval period for the appearance of new versions of an ancient author.</p>
<h2 id="macer-on-herbs-its-great-currency">Macer on herbs; its great currency,</h2>
<p>With the possible exception of the <em>Herbarium</em> of the Pseudo-Apuleius, probably the best known single and distinct treatment of the virtues of herbs produced during the middle ages was the poem <em>De viribus herbarum</em> which circulated under the name of Macer Floridus.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>It was often cited by the medieval encyclopedists and other writers on nature and medicine in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup></p>
<p>It is found in an Anglo-Saxon version  [^612:3]</p>
<p>[^612:3]; Cotton, Vitellius C, III.</p>
<p>and was even translated into Danish in the early thirteenth century.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup></p>
<p>Manuscripts of it are very numerous  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup></p>
<p>and there are many early printed editions.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup></p>
<p>Even as recently as the first half of the nineteenth century a historian of medicine and natural science, in the preface of his edition of Macer, stated as one argument for the modern study of medieval medicine that much might be learned from writings of that period concerning the virtues of herbs.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">65</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="problem-of-date-and-author.">Problem of date and author.</h3>
<p>The poem was certainly not written by the classical poet, Aemilius Macer, who was a friend of Vergil and Ovid, and whose descriptions of plants, birds, and reptiles are cited by Pliny in his <em>Natural History</em> and also preserved in some extracts by the grammarians. Proof of this is that our poem cites Pliny; in fact, it cites him more frequently than any other author. It also cites Galen six times, Dioscorides four, and as late an author as Oribasius twice.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>But Oribasius is not the latest author cited since Walafrid Strabo is also used.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">67</a></sup></p>
<p>Strabo was born about 806, became abbot of Reichenau in 842, and died in 849. In his Hortulus, a poem dedicated to Grimoald, the abbot of St. Gall, he described twenty-three herbs in 444 hexameters.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">68</a></sup></p>
<p>Indeed Stadler holds that the Pseudo-Macer uses the <em>De gradibus</em> of Constantinus Africanus who did not die until 1087.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">69</a></sup><br>
The true author of our poem ascribed to Macer is said on the authority of certain manuscripts to have been an Odo of Meung on the Loire, apparently the same town as the birthplace of Jean Clopinel or de Meun, the learned author of the latter portion of <em>The Romance of the Rose</em>.</p>
<p>Choulant, however, did not regard this as sufficiently proved, and Stadler has recently noted that some manuscripts ascribe the poem to a physician, Odo of Verona; and others to the Cistercian, Odo of Morimont, who died in 1161.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70">70</a></sup></p>
<p>In any case, unless the mentions of Strabo are later interpolations, the author must be regarded as post-Carolingian, while he cannot be later than the eleventh century in view of a remark of Sigebertus Gemblacensis in 1112,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71">71</a></sup></p>
<p>the Anglo-Saxon version, the many twelfth century manuscripts, and the frequent use of his poem in the <em>Regimen Salernitanum</em>  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72">72</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Macer seems a pseudonym to begin with, the original poem, consisting of 2269 lines in which 77 herbs are discussed, is sometimes accompanied by additional lines regarded as spurious.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73">73</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="virtues-ascribed-to-herbs">Virtues ascribed to herbs</h3>
<p>Our poet does not appear to have much of his own to offer on the subject of the virtues of herbs. When he does not cite his authority by name, he usually qualifies the statement made by a vaguer “they say” or “it is said.” He does not connect certain herbs with certain stars or otherwise introduce anything that can be called astrological. He repeats Pliny’s statement of the powers ascribed to vervain by the magi, such as to gain one’s desires, win the friendship of the powerful, and dispel disease and fever. Pliny had spoken of the magi as “raving about this herb”; our poet says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Although potent Nature can grant such virtues,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet they really seem to us idle old-wives’ tales."  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74">74</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless he himself about fifteen lines before had said of the vervain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If, holding this herb in the hand, you ask the patient,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Say, brother, how are you?’ and the patient answers, ‘Well,’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He will live; but if he says ‘ill,’ there is no hope of safety."  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75">75</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our poet not only thus associates with herbs the virtue of divination, but is guilty of sympathetic magic when he believes that the ancients learned by experience that Dragontea or snake-weed dispels poisons, wards off snakes, and is good for snake-bite from observing the similarity between the spotted rind of the herb and the skin of a snake.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76">76</a></sup></p>
<p>Odo or Macer repeats Galen’s story of curing an epileptic boy by suspending a root of peony about his neck,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77">77</a></sup></p>
<p>and later asserts the same virtue for the herb pyrethrum.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78">78</a></sup></p>
<p>Even more magical is the ceremony for curing toothache which he takes from Pliny and which consists in digging up the herb <em>Senecion</em> without use of iron, touching the aching tooth with it three times, and then replacing the plant in the place where it came from so that it will grow again.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79">79</a></sup></p>
<p>Pliny is also cited concerning the swallow’s restoring the sight of its young by swallow-wort.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80">80</a></sup></p>
<p>Our poet also repeats such beliefs as that the herb Buglossa preserves the memory,  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81">81</a></sup></p>
<p>or that the smoke of Aristochia dispels demons and exhilarates infants.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82">82</a></sup></p>
<p>If the hives are anointed with the juice of the herb Barrocus, the bees will not desert them; while carrying that plant with one is a protection against the stings of bees, wasps, and spiders.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83">83</a></sup><br>
Among the virtues most frequently attributed to herbs are expelling or killing worms, curing pestiferous bites or poisons, and provoking urine or vomiting. On the whole, “Macer” contains only a moderate amount of superstition, although rather more proportionally than Walafrid Strabo.</p>
<h3 id="experiments-of-macer.">Experiments of Macer.</h3>
<p>Although Odo or Macer seems to make no original contribution to botany, cites authorities frequently, and speaks  often of the ancients or men of old, he also at least once cites “experts”  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn84" id="fnref84">84</a></sup></p>
<p>and we have also seen his belief that the ancients had tested the virtues of plants by experience. This rather slight experimental character of the work is further emphasized in some manuscripts of it, where the title is “Experiments of Macer” and the matter seems to have been re-arranged under diseases instead of by herbs.  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85">85</a></sup></p>

These large illuminations include a portrait of Juliana Anicia, an ornamental peacock with tail spread, groups of doctors engaged in medical discussions, and Dioscorides himself seated writing, and again seated on a folding stool receiving the herb marvdragora (which, of course, was a medieval favorite) from a female figure personifying Discovery (Εὕρησις or Εξεύρεση), “while in the foreground a dog dies in agony,” presumably from the fatal effects of the herb. There are rough reproductions of this last picture in Woltmann and Woermann, <em>History of Painting</em>, I, 192-3, and Singer (1921) ,62. When the text proper begins the illuminations are confined to medicinal plants.<br>
Other early Greek manuscripts are the Codex Neapolitanns, formerly at Vienna, now at St. Mark’s, Venice, an eighth century palimpsest from Bobbio, and a Paris codex, (BN Greek 2179) of the ninth century. An Arabic translation from the Greek seems to have been made about 850; a century later the Byzantine emperor sent a Greek manuscript of Dioscorides to the caliph in Spain.<br>
For the full text of the <em>De materia medica</em> we are dependent on MSS of the 11th, 12th, 13th and later centuries. <a href="#fnref43" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
