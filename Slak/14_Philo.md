### Philo the mediator between Hellenistic and Jewish-Christian thought.
 
There probably Is no other man who marks so well the fusion of Hellenic and Hebrew ideas and the transition from them to Christian thought as Philo Judaeus. [^348:1] 

 [^348:1]: The literature dealing in general with Philo and his philosophy is too extensive to indicate here, while there has been no study primarily devoted to our interest in him. It may be useful to note, however, the most recent editions of his works and studies concerning him, from which the reader can learn of earlier researches. See also Leopold Cohn, _The Latest Researches on Philo of Alexandria_ (Reprinted from The Jewish Quarterly Review), London, 1892.  
The most recent edition of the Greek text of Philo's works is by L. Cohn and P.Wendland, _Philonis Alexandrini opera quae supersunt, Berlin, 1896-1915, in six vols. The earlier edition was by Mangey. Recent editions of single works are:  
F.C.Conybeare, Philo about the _Contemplative Life_, critically edited with a defence of its genuineness, 1895.  
E.Brehier, _Commentaire allegorique des Saintes Lois apres l'auvre des six jours_, Greek and French, 1909.  
In the passages from Philo quoted in this chapter I have often availed myself of the wording of the English translation by C.D.Yonge in four vols., 1854-1855. The Latin translation of Philo's works made from the Greek by Lilius Tifernates for Popes Sixtus IV and Innocent VIII is preserved at the Vatican in a series of six MSS written during the years 1479-1484: Vatic. Lat., 180-185.

He flourished at Alexandria in the first years of our era, the exact dates both of his birth and of his death are uncertain, and speaks of himself as an old man at the time of his participation in the embassy of Jews to the Emperor Gaius or CaliguIa in 40 A. D. He repeats the doctrines of the Greek philosophers and anticipates much that the church fathers discuss. Before the Neo-Platonists he regards matter as the source of all evil and feels the necessity of mediators, angels or demons, between God and man. Before the medieval revival of Aristotle and natural philosophy he tries to reconcile the Mosaic account of creation with belief in a world soul, and monotheism with astrology. Before the rise of Christian monasticism he describes in his treatise On the Contemplative _Life_ an ascetic community of _Therapeutae_ at Lake Maerotis. [^349:1] 

 [^349:1]: The genuineness of this treatise, denied by Graetz and Lucius in the mid-nineteenth century, was amply demonstrated by L. Massebieau, Revue de I'Histoire des Religions, XVI (1887), 170-98, 284-319; Conybeare, Philo about the _Contemplative Life_, Oxford, 1895; and P.Wendland, Die Therapeuten und die Philonische Schrift vom Beschaulichen Leben, in Jahrb. f. Class. Philologie, Band 22 (1896), 693-770. In St. John's College Library, Oxford, in a manuscript of the early eleventh century (MS 128, fol. 215 fif) with Dionysius the Areopagite on the ecclesiastical hierarchy, is, Philonis de excircumcisione credentibus in Aegypto Christianis simul et monachis ex suprascripto ab eo sermone de vita theorica aut de orantibus. 

After Pythagoras he enlarges upon the mystic significance of numbers. After Plato he repeats the conception of an ideal city of God which was to gain such a hold upon Christian imagination. [^350:1] 

 [^350:1]: De mundi opificio, caps. 49 and 50. 

After the Stoics he proclaims the doctrine of the law of nature, holds that the institution of human slavery is absolutely contrary to it, and writes 

> "a treatise to prove that every virtuous man is free" and that to be virtuous is to live in conformity to nature. [^350:2] 

 [^350:2]: _On the Contemplative Life_, Chapter 9.

He had previously written another treatise designed to show that 

> "every wicked man "was a slave," [^350:3] 

 [^350:3]: So he states in the opening sentences of the other treatise; it is not extant. 

and he held a theory which we met in the Enoch literature and shall meet again in a number of subsequent writers that sin was punished naturally by forces of nature such as floods and thunderbolts. He did not originate the practice of allegorical interpretation of the Bible but he is our first great extant example thereof. He even went so far as to regard the tree of _Life_ and the story of the serpent tempting Eve as purely symbolical, an attitude which found little favor with Christian writers. [^350:4] 

 [^350:4]: _De mundi opificio_, caps. 54 and 55.

His effort by means of the allegorical method to find in the books of the Pentateuch all the attractive concepts and theories which he had learned from the Greeks became later in the Christian apologists an assertion that Plato and Pythagoras had borrowed their doctrines from Abraham and Moses. His doctrine of the logos had a powerful influence upon the writers of the New Testament and the theology of the early church, [^350:5]  
Yet Philo affirms that no more perfect good than philosophy exists in human _Life_ and in both literary style and erudition he is a Hellene to his very finger tips. The recent tendency, seen especially in German scholarship, to deny the writers of the Roman Empire any capacity for original thought and to trace back their ideas to unextant authors of a supposedly much more productive Hellenistic age has perhaps been carried too far. But if we may not regard Philo as a great originator, and it is evident that he borrowed many of his ideas, he was at any rate a great transmitter of thought, a mediator after his own heart between Jews and Greeks, and between them both and the  Christian writers to come. Standing at the close of the Hellenistic age and at the opening of the Roman period, he occupies in the history of speculative and theological thought an analogous position to that of Pliny the Elder in the history of natural science, gathering up the lore of the past, perhaps improving it with some additions of his own, and exercising a profound influence upon the age to come. 

 [^350:5]: Reville,J., _Le logos, d'apres Philon d'Alexandrie_, Geneve, 1877. 

### His influence upon the middle ages was indirect.

Philo's medieval influence, however, was probably more indirect than Pliny's and passed itself on through yet other mediators to the more remote times. Comparatively speaking, the _Natural History_ of Pliny probably was more important in the middle ages than in the early Roman Empire when other authorities prevailed in the Greek-speaking world. Philo's influence on the other hand must soon be transmitted through Christian, and then again through Latin, mediums. This is indicated by the fact that to-day many of his works are wholly lost or extant only in fragments [^351:1] 

 [^351:1]: Lincoln College, Oxford, has a 12th century MS in Greek of the _De vita Mosis_ and _De virtutibus_,  - MS 34.

or in Armenian versions, [^351:2] 

 [^351:2]: The _Alexander sive de antmalibus_ and the complete text of the _De providentia_ exist only in Armenian translation, see Cohn (1892), p. 16. _The Biblical Antiquittes_, extant only in an imperfect Latin version, is not regarded as a genuine work, - see W.O.E.Oesterlev and G.H.Box, _The Biblical Antiquities of Philo_, now first translated from the old Latin version by M. R. James (1917), p. 7.

and that we have no sure information as to the order in which they were composed. [^351:3] 

 [^351:3]: Cohn (1892), II.

But his initial force is none the less of the greatest moment, and seems amply sufficient to justify us in selecting his writings as one of our starting points. The extent to which one is apt to find in the writings of Philo passages which are fore- runners of the statements of subsequent writers, may be illustrated by the familiar story of King Canute and the tide. Philo in his work On Dreams [^351:4] speaks of the custom of the Germans of charging the incoming tide with their drawn swords. But what especially concern us are Philo's statements concerning magic, astrology, the stars, the perfection and power of numbers, demons, and the interpretation of dreams. 

 [^351:4]: II, 17.

### Good and bad magic.

Philo draws a distinction between magic in the good and bad sense. The former and true magical art is the lore of learned Persians called _Magi_ who investigate nature more minutely and deeply than is usual and explain divine virtues clearly. [^352:1]  
The latter magic is a spurious imitation of the other, practised by quacks and impostors, old-wives and slaves, who by means of incantations and the like procedure profess to change men from love to hatred or vice versa and who 

 [^352:1]: (_Quod omnis probus liber sit_, cap. xi); also _The Law Concerning Murderers_, cap. 4.

> "deceive unsuspecting persons and waste whole families away by degrees and without making any noise." 

It is to this adulterated and evil magic that Philo again refers when he likens political life to Joseph's coat of many colors, stained with the blood of wars, and in which a very little truth is mixed up with a great deal of sophistry akin to that of the augurs, ventriloquists, sorcerers, jugglers and enchanters, 

> "from whose treacherous arts it is very difficult to escape." [^352:2] 

 [^352:2]: On Dreams, I, 38.

This distinction between a magic of the wise and of nature and that of vulgar impostors is one which we shall find in many subsequent writers, although it was not recognized by Pliny. Philo also antecedes numerous Christian commentators upon the _Book of Numbers_ [^352:3] in considering the vexed question whether Balaam was an evil enchanter and diviner, or a divine prophet, or whether he combined magic and prophecy, and thus indicated that the former art is not evil but has divine approval. Philo's conclusion is the more usual one that Balaam was a celebrated diviner and magician, and that it is impossible that 

 [^352:3]: Numbers XXNII-XXV.  Balaam is, of course, referred to in a number of other passages of the Bible: Deut., XXIII, 3-6; Joshua, XIII, 22; XXIV, 9-10; Nehemiah, XIII, 1ff; Micah, VI, 5; Second Peter, II, 15-16; Jude, 11; Revelation, II, 14.

> "holy inspiration should be combined with magic," 

but that in the particular case of his blessing Israel the spirit of divine prophecy took possession of him and "drove all his artificial 
system of cunning divination out of his soul." [^353:1] 

 [^353:1]: _Vita Mosis_, I, 48-50. Besides discussion of Balaam in various Biblical commentaries,  dictionaries, and encyclopedias, see Hengstenberg, _Die Geschichte Bileams und seime Weissagungen_, 1842.

### Stars not gods nor first causes.

Philo has considerably more to say upon the subject of astrology than upon that of magic. He was especially concerned to deny that the stars were first causes or independent gods. He chided the Chaldean adepts in genethlialogy for recognizing no other god than the universe and no other causes than those apparent to the senses, and for regarding fate and necessity as gods and the periodical revolutions of the heavenly bodies as the cause of all good and evil. [^353:2] 

 [^353:2]: _De migrat. Abrahami_, cap. 32.

Philo more than once exhorts the reader to follow Abraham's example in leaving Chaldea and the science of genethlialogy and coming to Charran to a comprehension of the true nature of God. [^353:3]

 [^353:3]: _De migrat. Abrahami_, and. _De somniis_, cap. 10.

He agreed with Moses that the stars should not be worshiped and that they had been created by God, and more than that, not created until the fourth day, in order that it might be perfectly clear to men that they were not the primary causes of things. [^353:4]

 [^353:4]: De monarchia, I, x. De snundi optficto, cap. 14.

### But rational and virtuous animals, and God's viceroys over inferiors

Philo, nevertheless, despite his attack on the Chaldeans, believed in much which we should call astrological. The stars, although not independent gods, are nevertheless divine images of surpassing beauty and possess divine natures, although they are not incorporeal beings. Philo distinguishes foys over between the stars, men, and other animals as follows. The beasts are capable of neither virtue nor vice; human beings are capable of both; the stars are intelligent animals, but incapable of any evil and wholly virtuous. [^353:5] 

 [^353:5]: _De mundi opificio_, caps. 18, 50 and 24. See also his _De gigantibus_ and _Περὶ τοῦ θεοπέμπτους εἶναι τοὺς ὀνείρους_ - Perí toú theopémptous eínai toús oneírous - The gods of the gods are these dreams.

They were native-born citizens of the world long before its first human citizen had been naturalized. [^353:6] 

 [^353:6]: Ibid., Cap. 50. Huet, the noted French scholar of the 17th century, states in his edition of Origen that “Philo after his custom repeats an opinion of Plato’s and almost his very words for ... he asserts that the stars are not only animals but also the purest intellects." Migne PG, XVII, col. 978.

God, moreover, did not postpone their creation until the fourth day because superiors are subject to inferiors. On the contrary they are the viceroys of the Father of all and in the vast city of this universe the ruling class is made up of the planets and fixed stars, and the subject class consists of all the natures beneath the moon. [^354:1] 

 [^354:1]: _De monarchia_, I, i; _De mundi opificio_, cap. 14. 

A relation of natural sympathy exists between the different parts of the universe, and all things upon the earth are dependent upon the stars. [^354:2] 

 [^354:2]: _De monarchia_, I, i; _De migratione Abrahamii_ cap. 32; _De mundi opificio_, cap. 40. 

### They do not cause evil; but it is possible to predict the future from their motions.

Philo of course will not admit that evil is caused either by the virtuous stars or by God working through them. As has been said, he attributed evil to matter or to "the natural changes of the elements," [^354:3] drawing a line between God and nature in much the fashion of the church fathers later.

 [^354:3]: Eusebius, _De praep. Evang_., cap. 13. 
 
> But he granted that "before now some men have conjectural predicted disturbances and commotions of the earth from the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, and innumerable other events which have turned out most exactly true." [^354:4] 

 [^354:4]:  _De mundi opificio_, cap. 19. 

Philo's interest in astronomy and astrology is further suggested by his interpretation of the eleven stars of Joseph's dream as referring to the signs of the zodiac, [^354:5] 

 [^354:5]: _De somniis_, II, 16. 

Joseph himself making the twelfth; and by his interpreting the ladder in Jacob's dream which stretched between earth and heaven as referring to the air, [^354:6] into which earth's evaporation dissolve, while the moon is not pure ether like the other stars but itself contains some air. This accounts, Philo thinks, for the spots upon the moon - an explanation which I do not remember having met in subsequent writers. 

 [^354:6]: _De somniis_., I, 22.

### Jewish astrology 

Josephus [^354:7] and the Jews in general of Philo's time were equally devoted to astrology according to M&uuml;nter, who says: 

 [^354:7]: _De hello Jud_., V, 5, 5; _Antiq_., III. 7, 7-8. 

> "Only their astrology was subordinated to theism. The one God always appeared as the master of the host of heaven. But they regarded the stars as living divine beings and powers of heaven." [^355:1] 

 [^355:1]: _Der Stern der Weisen_ (1827), p. 36. "Nur war ihre Astrologie dem Theismus untergeordnet. Der Eine Gott erschien immer als der Herrscher des Himmelsheeres. Sie betrachteten aber die Sterne als lebende gottliche Wesen und Machte des Himmels." 

In the Talmud later we read that the hour of Abraham's birth was announced by the stars and that he feared from his observations of the constella- tions that he would go childless. M&uuml;nter also gives examples of the belief of the rabbis in the influence of the stars upon the destiny of the Jewish people and upon the fate of individual men, and of their belief that a star would announce the coming of the Messiah. [^355:2] 

 [^355:2]: M&uuml;nter (1827), pp. 38-39, 43, 45, etc. On the subject of Jewish astrology see also: D.Nielsen, Die altarabische Mondreligion und die mosaische Uberlieferung, Strasburg, 1904; F.Hommel, Der Gestirndienst der alien Araber und die altisraelitische Uberlieferung, M&uuml;nich, 1901. 

### Perfection of the number seven.

From Philo's astrology it is an easy step to his frequent reveries concerning the perfection and mystic significance of certain numbers, - a train of thought which was continued by many of the church fathers, and is also found in various pagan writers of the Roman Empire. [^355:3] 

 [^355:3]: Such as Aulus Gellius, Macrobius, and Censorinus. These writers seem to have taken it from Varro. We have also noted number mysticism in Plutarch's Essays. 

Thomas Browne in his enquiry into "Vulgar Errors" [^355:4] was inclined to hold Philo even more responsible than Pythagoras or Plato for the dissemination of such doctrines. Philo himself recognizes the close connection between astrology and number mysticism, when, after affirming the dependence of all earthly things upon the heavenly bodies, he adds: 

 [^355:4]: Browne (1650) IV, 12. 

> "It is in heaven, too, that the ratio of the number seven began." [^355:5] 

 [^355:5]: _De mumdi opificio_, cap. 40. 

Philo doubts if it is possible to express adequately the glories of the number seven, but he feels that he ought at least to attempt it and devotes a dozen chapters of his treatise on the creation of the world to it, [^355:6] to say nothing of other passages. 

 [^355:6]: _De mumdi opificio_, caps. 30-42. 

He notes that there are seven planets, seven circles of heaven, four quarters of the moon of seven days each, that such constellations as the Pleiades and Ursa Major consist of seven stars, and that children born at the end of seven months live, while those who see the light in the eighth month die. In diseases the seventh is a critical day.  
Also there are either seven ages of man's life, as Hippocrates says, or, in accordance with Solon's lines, man's three-score years and ten may be subdivided into ten periods of seven years each. The lyre of seven strings corresponds to the seven planets, and in speech there are seven vowels. There are seven divisions of the head - eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth, seven divisions of the body, seven kinds of motion, seven things seen, and even the senses are seven rather than five if we add the vocal and generative organs. [^356:1] 

 [^356:1]: For the later influence of such doctrines in the Mohammedan world see D.B.Macdonald, _Muslim Theology, Jurisprudence, and Constitutional Theory_, 1903, pp. 42-3, concerning the “Seveners” and the “Twelvers” and the doctrine of the hidden Iman.

### And of fifty.

Philo's ideal sect, the Therapeutae, are wont to assemble as a prelude to their greatest feast at the end of seven weeks, 

> "venerating not only the simple week of seven days but also its multiplied power," [^356:2] 

 [^356:2]: D.B.Macdonald, _Muslim Theology, Jurisprudence, and Constitutional Theory_, 1903, “Thus we have a scribes of seven times seven Imans, the first, and thereafter each seventh, having the superior dignity of Prophet. The last of the forty nine Imans, this Muhammad ibn Isma'il, is the greatest and last ot the Prophets."

but the chief festival itself occurs on the fiftieth day, 

> "the most holy and natural of numbers, being compounded of the power of the rightangled triangle, which is the principle of the origination and condition of the whole." [^356:3] 

 [^356:3]: _De. vita. contemplativa_, cap. 8. It will be recalled that the fifty books of the _Digest_ of Justinian are similarly divided.

### Also of four and six

The numbers four and six, however, yield little to seven and fifty in the matter of perfection. It was the fourth day that God chose for the creation of the heavenly bodies, and He did not need six days for the entire work of creation, but it was fitting that that perfect work should be accomplished in a perfect number of days. Six is the product of the first female number, two, and the first male number, three. Indeed, the first three numbers, one, two, and three, whether added or multiplied, give six. [^356:4] 

 [^356:4]: _De mundi opificio_, cap. 3.

As for four, there are that many elements and seasons; it is the only number produced by the same number - two - whether added to itself or multiplied by itself; it is the first square and as such the emblem of justice and equality; it also represents the cube or solid, as the number one stands for a point, two for a line, and three for a surface. [^357:1] 

 [^357:1]: _De mundi opificio_, caps. 15-16. See also on perfect numbers _On the Allegories of the Sacred Laws_.

Furthermore four is the source of "the all-perfect decade," since one and two and three and four make ten. At this we begin to suspect, and with considerable justification, as the writings of other devotees of the philosophy of numbers would show, that the number of perfect numbers is legion. We may not, however, follow Philo much farther on this topic. Suffice it to add that he finds the fifth day fitting for the creation of animals possessed of five senses, [^357:2] 

 [^357:2]: _De mundi opificio_, cap. 20.

while he divides the ten plagues of Egypt into three dealing with the more solid elements, earth and water, and performed by Aaron; three dealing with air and fire which were entrusted to Moses; the seventh was committed to both Aaron and Moses; while the other three God reserved for Himself. [^357:3] 

 [^357:3]: _Vita Mosis_, I, 17.

### Spirits of the air.

Philo believed in a world of spirits, both the angels of Spirits of the Jews and the demons of the Greeks. When God said: the air. 

> "Let us make man," 

Philo believed that He was addressing those assistant spirits who should be held responsible for the viciousness to which man alone of all creation is liable. [^357:4]

 [^357:4]: _De mundi opificio_, cap. 24.

Of the divine rational natures Philo regarded some as incorporeal, others like the stars as possessed of bodies. [^357:5] 

 [^357:5]: _De mundi opificio_, cap. 20.

He also believed that there were spirits in the air as well as afar off in heaven. He could not see why the air should not be inhabited when there were stars in the ether and fish in the sea as well as other animals upon land. [^357:6] Indeed he argued that it would be absurd that the element which was essential for the vitality even of land and aquatic animals should have no living beings of its own. That these spirits of the air must be invisible did not trouble him, since the human soul is also invisible. 

 [^357:6]: _De somniis_, II, 21-22.

### Interpretation of dreams

Of Philo's five books on dreams only two are extant. They suffice to show, however, that he accepted the art of divination from dreams. Of dreams he distinguished three varieties: those direct from God which require no interpretation; those in which the dreamer's mind moves in unison with the world soul, and which are neither entirely clear nor yet very obscure - an instance is Jacob's vision of the ladder; and third, those in which the mind is moved by a prophetic frenzy of its own, and which require the science of interpretation - such dreams were Joseph's concerning his brothers, and those of the butler and the baker at Pharaoh's court. [^358:1] 

 [^358:1]: _De somniis_, II, 1.

### Politics are akin to magic.

The recent war and its accompaniments and sequels have brought home to some the conviction that our modern civilization is after all not vastly superior to that of some preceding ages. To those who still imagine that because modern science has freed us from much past superstition concerning nature, we are therefore free from political fakirs, from social absurdities, and from fallacious procedure and reasoning in many departments of life, the reading may be recommended of a passage in Philo's treatise on dreams, [^359:1] in which he classifies the art of politics along with that of magic. He compares Joseph's coat of many colors to "the much-variegated web of political affairs" where along with "the smallest possible portion of truth" falsehoods of every shade of plausibility are interwoven; and he compares politicians and statesmen to augurs, ventriloquists, and sorcerers, 

> "men skillful in juggling and in incantations and in tricks of all kinds, from whose treacherous arts it is very difficult to escape." 

 [^359:1]: Cap. 38.

He adds that Moses very naturally represented Joseph's coat as blood-stained, since all statecraft is tainted with wars and bloodshed.  
Twelve centuries later we find Philo's association of politicians with magicians repeated by his compatriot Moses Maimonides in the _More Nevochim_ or _Guide for the Perplexed_, [^359:2] 

 [^359:2]: II, 37.

a work which appeared almost immediately in Latin translation and from which this very passage is cited by Albertus Magnus in his discussion of divination by dreams. [^359:1] 

 [^359:1]: Cap. 5.

### A thought repeated by Moses Maimonides and Albertus Magnus.

There are some men, says Albert, in whom the intellect is abundant and active and clear. Such men are akin to the superior substances, that is, to the angels and stars, and therefore Moses of Egypt, i.e., Maimonides, calls them sages. But there are others who, according to Albert, confound true wisdom with sophistry and are content with mere probabilities and imaginations and are at home in. "rhetorical and civil matters." Maimonides, however, described this class a little differently, saying that in them the imaginative faculty is preponderant and the rational faculty imperfect. 

> "Whence arises the sect of politicians, of legislators, of diviners, of enchanters, of dreamers, . . . and of prestidigitation who work marvels by strange cunning and occult arts." [^359:2] 

 [^359:2]: Since I finished this chapter, I have noted that the "folk-lore in the Old Testament" has led Sir James Frazer to write a passage on "the harlequins of history" somewhat similar to that of Philo on Joseph's coat of many colors. After remarking that friends and foes behold these politicians of the present and historical figures of the future from opposite sides and see only that particular hue of the coat which happens to be turned toward them, Sir James concludes (1918), II, 502, "It is for the impartial historian to contemplate these harlequins from every side and to paint them in their coats of many colors, neither altogether so white as they appeared to their friends nor altogether so black as they seemed to their enemies." But who can paint out the bloodstains?
