## Latin astrology and divination: especially in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries 

### Astrology in Gaul before the twelfth century. 

Astrology had continued to flourish in Gaul in the last declining days of the Roman Empire, despite the strictures of Christian writers and clergy,  [^1:1] and it was one of the first subjects to revive after the darkness of the Merovingian period. Two centuries ago Goujet in a treatise on the state of the sciences in France from the death of Charlemagne to that of King Robert noted that from the reign of Charlemagne astronomy continued to be increasingly studied. 

 [^1:1]: See De la Ville de Mirmont, _L'Astrologie chez les Gallo-Romains_, Bordeaux, 1904; also published in _Revue des Etudes anciennes_, 1902, p. 115; 1903, p. 255; 1906, p. 128. 

> "The councils in their decrees, the bishops in their statutes, the kings in their capitularies, expressly recommended the study of it to the clergy."  [^1:2] 

 [^1:2]: Goujet (1737), p. 50; cited by C.Jourdain (1838), pp. 28-9.

With the study of astronomy naturally developed a belief in astrology. According to the Histoire Litt&eacute;raire de la France it became quite the fashion during the reign of Louis the Pious, Charlemagne's successor, when we are told that there was no great lord but had his own astrologer. Adalmus, before he became abbot of Castres, wasted much time upon this pseudo-science, and Rabanus Maurus showed tendencies in that direction. In the tenth century such celestial phenomena as comets and eclipses were feared as sinister portents, and men resorted to enchantments, auguries, and other forms of divination,  [^2:1] 

 [^2:1]: HL IV, 274-5; V, 182-3; VI, 9-10.

A brief treatise in a manuscript of the ninth century in the Vatican library also develops the thesis that comets signify disasters.  [^2:2] In the eleventh century Engelbert, a monk of Liege, and Odo, teacher at Tournai, were devoted to the study of the stars; and Gilbert Maminot, bishop of Lisieux, and for a time chaplain and physician  to William the Conqueror, would rather spend his nights in star-gazing than in sleep. 

 [^2:2]: Palat. Lat. 487, fol. 40, opening, "Nouo et insolito siderum ortu infausta quaedam ucl tristitia potius quam laeta ucl prospera miseris uentura significari mortalibus pene omnia ueterum aestimauit auctoritas."

> "But what was the outcome of all this toil and study?" inquires the _Histoire Litteraire_ and replies to its own question, ''The making of some wretched astrologers and not a single true astronomer !"  [^2:3] 

 [^2:3]: HL VII, 137.

## Medicine.

### Figures of astrological medicine.

These words were written nearly two hundred years ago, but such a recent investigation of manuscripts in French libraries as that of Wickersheimer on figures illustrative of astrological medicine from the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries has on the whole confirmed the importance of astrology in the meager learning of that time.  [^2:4] 

 [^2:4]: “Ernest Wickersheimer,  _Figures médico-astrologiques des neuvième, dixiéme et onzième siècles_, in _Transactions of the Seventeenth International Congress of Medicine, Section XXIII, History of Medicine_, London, 1913, p. 313 et seq. I have not seen A.Fischer _Aberglaube unter den Angelsachsen_, Meiningen, mor, or M.Förster, _Die Kleinlitteratur des Aberglaubens im Altenglischen_, in _Archiv. f. d. Studium d. Neuer. Sprachen_, vol. 110, pp. 3406-58.

The manuscripts in English libraries, I have found, tell a similar story. Of the human figures marked with the twelve signs of the zodiac, which become so common in the manuscripts by the fourteenth century, and in which the head rests upon the Ram, the feet on Pisces, while the intervening members of the body are marked by their respective signs, - of these Wickersheimer found none before the twelfth century. But in a medical manuscript of the eleventh century the twelve signs with their names and the names of the parts of the human body to which they apply are grouped about a half figure of Christ, who has His right hand raised to bless, while about His head is a halo or sun-disk with twelve rays.  [^3:1]  
Less favorable to astrology is the accompanying legend, 

 [^3:1]: Charles Singer, _Studies in the History and Method of Science_, Oxford, 1917, Plate XV, opposite p. 40, reproduces this illumination. The MS, BN 7028, seems to have once belonged to the abbey of St.Hilary at Poitiers. 

> "According to the ravings of the philosophers the twelve signs are thus denoted." 

On the page following the text describes the twelve signs "according to the Gentiles." Schemes in which the world, the year, and man were associated, and where are shown the four elements, four seasons, four humors, four temperaments, four ages, four cardinal points, and four winds, are frequently found in extant manu- scripts of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries.  [^3:2] 

 [^3:2]: Besides those in France mentioned by Wickersheimer may be noted two of the tenth century at Munich: CLM 18629, fol._ 105, "Tabula cosmica cum nominibus ventorum, germanicorum quoque"; CLM 18764, fols. 79-80. "Schema de genitura mundi."   
Also Vatic. Lat. 645, 9th century, fol. 66, Ventorum imagines et m circulo Adam in medio ferarum; fol. 66v, Planetarum figura. This same MS contains a conjuration written in a later hand of the eleventh or twelfth century: fol. 4v, "In nomine patris. . . . Tres angeli ambulaverunt in monte. ..." 
For such an astrological diagram in an Arabic work of the tenth century see E.G.Browne (1921), 117-8. 

### The divine quaternities of Raoul Glaber.

Such association reminds one of the opening of the chronicle of Raoul Glaber, written in the eleventh century, 

> "Since we are to treat of events in the four quarters of the earth, it will be well to touch first upon the power of divine and abstract quaternity." 

There are four elements, he gives us to understand, four virtues and four senses. There are four Gospels and they have their relation to the four elements. Matthew, dealing with Christ's incarnation, corresponds to earth; Mark to water, since it emphasizes baptism; Luke to air, because it is the longest Gospel; and John to fire or ether as the most spiritual. In like manner can be associated with the four cardinal virtues those four famous rivers which had their sources in Paradise: Phison and prudence, Geon and temperance, the Tigris and fortitude, the Euphrates and justice. Finally the ages of the world are found to be four by Raoul, instead of the six eras corresponding to the days of creation which we find in Isidore, Bede, and other medieval historians; and these four ages also relate to the four virtues. The days of Abel, Enoch, and Noah were days of prudence; but on leaving Noah we have temperance marking the age of Abraham and the patriarchs; fortitude is the feature of the time of Moses and the prophets; while justice characterizes the period since the incarnation of the Word. 

### Celestial portents and other marvels.

The faith of Raoul and his contemporaries in the mystic significance of numbers, if not also in astrology, and the fact that they were constantly on the lookout for portents and prodigies, are further attested by the stress laid in his chronicle upon the thousandth anniversaries of Christ's birth and of His passion. Says Raoul, 

> "After the multiplicity of prodigies which, although some came a little before and some a trifle afterwards, happened in the world around the thousandth year of Christ the Lord, there were many industrious men of sagacious mind who prophesied that there would be others not inferior to these in the thousandth year of our Lord's passion." 

That they were not mistaken in this premonition he shows later by several chapters, including an account of the eclipse of the sun in that year. Like many another medieval historian, Raoul is careful to note the appearance of comets - in the Bayeux tapestry of the same century one marks the death of Edward the Confessor; Raoul also believes that if a living person is visited by spirits, either good or evil, it is a sign of his approaching death ; he holds the usual view that demons may sometimes work marvels by divine permission, and tells of a magician- impostor whom he saw work miracles upon pseudo-relics.  
But from the superstition of medieval chroniclers we must turn back to astrological manuscripts proper. 

### An eleventh century calendar.

An eleventh century calendar at Amiens  [^4:1] reveals both a simple form of astrological medicine and a belief in some peculiar significance of the number seven, whether as a sacred or an astrological number. 

 [^4:1]: Amiens, fonds Lescalopier, 2, 11th century, fols. 1-12. 

At the head of each month are brief instructions as to what herbs to use during that month, as to bleeding and bathing, and what disease may most easily be cured then.  [^4:2] 

 [^4:2]: For instance, for February, "Bibe agrimoniam et apii semen; oculos turbulentos sanare debes": for March, "Merum dulce primum bibe, assum balneum usita, sanguinem non minuas, ruta et levestico utere." 

In the same manuscript one miniature shows someone striking seven bells with a hammer, perhaps as notes in a scale, and another miniature represents a seven-branched candlestick, of which the branches are respectively labeled, "Spirit of piety, Spirit of fortitude, Spirit of intellect, Spirit of wisdom, Spirit of prudence, Spirit of science, Spirit of the fear of God."  [^4:3] 

 [^4:3]: Amiens, fonds Lescalopier, 2, 11th century, fols. II and 19. 

### Astrology and divination in ecclesiastical compoti.

Indeed works of astrology and divination are especially likely to be found in the same manuscripts with ecclesiastical calendars and coniputi. Computus or compotus, as one manuscript states, was 

> "the science considering times."  [^4:4] 

 [^4:4]: Pembroke 278, early 14th century, fol. 25, "Compotus est sciencia considerans tempora." 

For example, in a brief compotus of the ninth century  [^4:5] a divining sphere of Pythagoras occurs twice, and we have also a moon book, an account of the Egyptian days, and a method of divination from winds. 

 [^4:5]: BN nouv. acq. 1616, 14 leaves.

In a twelfth century manuscript,  [^4:6] 

 [^4:6]: BN 7299 A. 

sandwiched in between calendars and reckonings of Easter and eclipses and Bede's work _On the Natures of Things_, are a sphere of divination, an account of Egyptian days, a method of divination from thunder, and a portion of a work on judicial astrology beginning with the eleventh chapter which tells how to determine whether anyone will be poor or rich by inspection of the planet in his nativity.  [^4:7] 

 [^4:7]: BN 7299A, fols, 35v, 37V, 56r. 

### Notker on the mystic date of Easter.

The very dating of Easter itself might be the occasion for indulging in mystic speculation of a semi-astrological nature. Thus Notker Labeo, c 950-1022, the well-known monk of St.Gall  [^5:1] 

 [^5:1]: Notker is especially famed for his translations with learned commentaries from Latin into German, of which five are extant, namely: _The Consolation of Philosophy_ of Boethius, _The Marriage of Mercury_ and _Philology_ of Martianus Capella, the _Psalter_, and Aristotle, _De categoriis_ and _De hiterprctatione_: see Piper, Die Schriften Notkers, Freiburg, 1882- 1883, vols. I - III. 

in a treatise to his disciple Erkenhard on four questions of _compotus_,  [^5:2] states that the principal problem, with which all others are connected, is that of the date of Easter. He gives the time as in the first full moon after the vernal equinox, but adds that this is because of a certain mystery.  
For if there were no mystery connected with the date of Easter, and it merely celebrated like other festivals the memory of an event which once happened, there is no doubt but that it would occur every year without variation upon the twenty-seventh of March, which was the day of the Lord's resurrection. But as after the vernal equinox the days grow longer than the nights, and as at the full of the moon its splendor is revolved on high, so we should overcome the darkness of sin by the light of piety and faith and turn our minds from earthly to celestial things, if we wish to celebrate Easter worthily. 

 [^5:2]: BN nouv. acq. 229, fols. lov- 14V. _Notker erkenhardo discipulo de nil guestionibus compoti_. It seems not to have been printed. 

### Prediction from the Kalends of January.

But let us consider in more detail the methods of divination found in such manuscripts. Simplest of all perhaps are predictions as to the character of the ensuing year according to the day of the week upon which the first of January falls. For example, 

> "If the kalends of January shall be on the Lord's day, the winter will be good and mild and warm, the spring windy, and the summer dry. Good vintage, increasing flocks; honey will be abundant; the old men will die; and peace will be made."  [^5:3] 

 [^5:3]: Cotton Tiberius A, III, a MS written in various hands before the Norman conquest, partly in Latin and partly in Anglo-Saxon, and containing among other things the Colloquy of Aelfric Our item occurs at fol. 34r in Latin with an Anglo-Saxon interlinear version, and at fol. 39V in Anglo-Saxon only.  
Cotton Titus D, XXVI, 10th century, fols. 10v-11v, gives a slightly different version for some days of the week. 

In some manuscripts these predictions concerning the weather, crops, wars, and king for the ensuing year are called _Supputatio Esdrae_ or signs which God revealed to the prophet Esdras.  [^6:1] 

 [^6:1]: Harleian 3017, 10th century, fols. 63r-64v, CLM 6382, 11th century, fol. 42, Supputatio Esdrae; Incipit, "Kal. Jan. si fuerint dominico die hiems bona erit."  
Vatican, Palat. Lat. 235, 10-11th century, fol. 39, "Subputatio quam subputavit Esdras in templo Hierusalem," opening, "Si in prima feria fuerint kl. lanuarii hiemps bona erit."  
Also found in Egerton 821, fol. 1r, which is of the twelfth century and adds a more elaborate method of divination according to what planet rules the first hour of the first night of January and which of its 28 mansions the moon is in. 
CLM 9921, 12th century, fol. 1, is a calendar with verses beginning, "Jani prima dies et septima fine timetur." 

In another manuscript  [^6:2] the weather for winter and summer is predicted according to the day of the week upon which Christmas falls and Lent begins. 

 [^6:2]: Sloane 475, this portion perhaps 11th century, fol. 2i7r. Other MSS of later date than the period we are now considering are: Harleian 2258, fol. 191, "prognostica a die nativitatis Domini a luna et somniis petita," predictions from Christmas, the moon, and dreams. CUL 1338, 15th century, fol. 65V, Prognostications derived from the day on which Christmas falls (in Latin); fol. 74V, Prognostications drawn from the day of the week on which the year commences, CU Trinity 1109, 14th century, fol. 148, "Prognostica anni sequentis ex die natalium Domini." 

Christmas of course was sometimes regarded as the first day of the new year and in any case it falls on the same day of the week as the following first of January. In a ninth century manuscript  [^6:3] predictions for the ensuing year are made according as there is wind in the night on Christmas eve and the eleven nights following. For instance, 

 [^6:3]: BN nouv. acq. 1616, 9th century, fol. 12V. Similar later MSS are:  
Digby 86, 13th century, fols. 32-4, Prognosticatio ex vento in nocte Natalis Domini, and fols. 40v-41r, "Les singnes del jour do Nouel," predictions in French according to the day of the week on which Christmas falls.  
Digby 88, 15th century, fol. 77, "Howe all ye yere ys rewlyde by the day that Christemas day fallythe on," and fol. 4 or, "Prognostication from the sight of the sun on Christmas and the ten days following" (Prognosticatio ex visione solis in die Natalis Domini et in decern diebus subsequentibus), and fol. 75, a poem of prognostications for Christmas day. This same MS contains a large number of other brief anonymous treatises in the fields of astrology and divination. 

> "If there is wind in the night on the night of the natal day of our Lord Jesus Christ, in that year kings and pontiffs will perish," and "If on twelfth night there shall be wind, kings will perish in war." 

### Other divination by the day of the week.

Divination from thunder is another form of judicial astrology, if it may so be called, found in these early manuscripts. Perhaps the simplest variety of it is according to the day of the week on which thunder is heard.  [^7:1] 

 [^7:1]: Titus D, XXVI, fol. ov. Tiberius A, III, fols. 38r and 3sr. Cockayne, Leechdoms etc, III, 150-205, in. RS vol. 35, published this and à number of other extracts from Tiberius A, III, and other early English MSS.  
Vienna 2245, 12th century, fols. 59r-69v are devoted to various prognostications, beginning with, "Three days are to be observed above all others," and ending with, "Thunder at dawn signifies the birth of a king.” A dream book by Daniel follows at fols. 69v-75r.

Predictions were also made according to the month in which thunder was heard,  [^7:2] 

 [^7:2]: Vatican Palat. Lat. 235, fol. 40, "In mense anuario si tonitru fuerit" In Egerton 821, 12th century, the significance of thunder is given according to the twelve signs of the zodiac, and we are told of what the Egyptians write, and of famine in Babylon. In CUL 1687, 13-14th century, fols. 68v-69r, Latin verses containing prognostications concerning thunder are followed by “a list of the number of quarters of flour, beer, etc, used in the year at the monastery and by “a note on the symbolism of the pastoral staff.”

or the direction from which it was heard.  [^7:3] It may be recalled that the three chapters of Bede's translation of some work on divination from thunder had been respectively devoted to these three methods by the direction from which the thunder is heard, the month, and the day of the week. 

 [^7:3]: Combined with the method by the day of the week in BN 7299A, 12th century, fol. 37v.

Nativities of infants are also given according to the day of the week on which they are born, and further taking into account whether the hour of birth is diurnal or nocturnal.  [^7:4] 

 [^7:4]: Tiberius A, III, fol. 63r; Vatican Palat. Lat. 235, fol. 40.

It is also regarded as important to note upon which day of the week the new moon occurs,  [^7:5] 

 [^7:5]: Tiberius A, III, fol. 38v.

and we are further informed of the various hours of the days of the week when it is advisable to perform bloodletting.  [^7:6] 

 [^7:6]: Sloane 475, fol. 135v.

In a method of divination according to the day of the week and the letters in the boy's or girl's name the Lord's day is assigned the number thirteen, the day "of the moon" eighteen, and that "of Mars" fifteen."  [^7:7]   
Since the days of the week bore the names of the planets, it was not strange that they should have been credited with something of the virtues of the stars. 

 [^7:7]: Sloane 475, fol 133r. The method is almost identical with that of the spheres of life and death, of which we shall speak presently. In CU Trinity 987, _The Canterbury Psalter_, about 1150 A.D., the value assigned _Dies Solis_ is 24. 

### Divination by the day of the moon.

A commoner method of divination and one more nearly approaching approved astrological doctrine was that by the day of the month or moon. Briefest of such moon-books is that which merely designates each of the thirty days as favorable or unfavorable.  [^8:1] 

  [^8:1]: Vatic. Palat. Lat. 235, fol. 40, "De lunae observatione: Luna I omnibus rebus agendis utilis."   
Tiberius A, III, fol. 63r, where, however, such parts of the day as morning and evening are further distinguished.  
Vatic. Palat. Lat. 485, 9th century, fol. 15V, "Ad sanguinem minuendum," merely states which days of the moon are favorable or unfavorable for blood-letting. 
St.John's 17, 1110 A.D., fol. 4, Luna quibus diebus bona est et quibus non; fol. 154V, a table of lucky and unlucky numbers. 

We also find a Lunarium for the sick, stating the patient's prospects from the day of the moon on which he contracted his illness;  [^8:2] 

 [^8:2]: Harleian 3017, fol. 58v; the Incipit states that it is by the same author as the preceding Sphere of Pythagoras and Apuleius.  
Titus D, XXVI, fol. 8.  
Cotton Caligula A, XV, 10th century, fol. 121V, Latin and Anglo-Saxon.   
Egerton 821, fol. 32r, is a twelfth century instance.   
The method seems combined or confused with the Egyptian days in Vatic. Palat. Lat. 485, 9th century, fol. 13V, "Dies aegyptiaci. Signa in quibus aegrotus an peri- clitare aut evadere non potest," but opening, "Luna I. qui ceciderit in infirmitatem difficile euadit." 

a work ascribed to "Saint Daniel" on nativities by the day of the moon;  [^8:3] 

 [^8:3]: Harleian 3017, fol. 58V, "Incipit lunarium sancti danihel de nativitate infantium. Luna I qui fuerit natus vitalis erit; Luna II, mediocris erit . . . Luna IIII, tractator regum erit . . . Luna XII, religiosus erit . . . Luna XXX, negotias multas tractabit." 
Tiberius A, III, fols. 63r and 34V.  
Titus D, XXVI, fols. 7v and 6v.  

and an equally brief interpretation of dreams upon the same basis.  [^8:4] 

 [^8:4]: Tiberius A, III, fol. 33v.  Titus D, XXVI, fol. 9r. CLM 6382, nth century, fol. 42, De somni ueris uel mendosis quidam incipiunt in aetatibus lunae exploratis. 

Or all these matters may be considered in the same treatise and each of them somewhat more fully, and we may be told whether the day is a good one on which to buy and sell, to board a ship, to enter a city, to operate upon a patient, to send children off to school, to breed animals, to build an aqueduct or mill, or whether it is best to abstain on it from most business. Also such predictions as that the boy born on that day will be illustrious, astute, wise, and lettered; that he will encounter danger on the water, but will live to old age if he escapes; while the girl born on the same day will be "chaste, benign, good-looking, and pleasing to men." That anyone who takes to his bed on that day will suffer a long sickness, but that it is a favorable day for blood-letting, and that one should not worry about dreams he has then, since they possess no significance either for good or evil. Also what chance there is of recovering articles stolen on that day.  [^9:1] 

 [^9:1]: Tiberius A, III, fols. 30V-33V,  
 "Finiunt somnia danielis prophete."  
Sloane 475, fols. 21 1-6, is almost identical, but I believe does not mention Daniel as its author.  
Vatic. Palat. Lat. 235, fol. 39V.  
BN nouv. acq. 1616, 9th century, is roughly similar but names no author and does not distinguish the fates of boys and girls. It usually states whether slaves who run away and thieves who steal on the day in question will be caught or escape. It opens and closes thus: "Luna prima qui incenditur in ipsa sanabitur et bona et in omnibus dare et accipere et nubere et navigare in mare et vendere et emere et omnis quicumque fugerit in ipsa aut servus aut liber non poterit sed capitur aut qui incendit incendio sanabitur (presumably an allusion to the medical practice of cauterization) et qui natus fuerit vitalis erit .../... Luna XXX bona est ambulare in piscatione et qui fugit post multos annos revertitur in loco suo et qui natus fuerit dives erit et honoratissimus erit et qui incadit aut manducet aut non vivet periculo mortis habebit."   
Titus D, XXVII, fols. 22-25r, "judicia de diebus quibusdam cuiusque mensis" ; fols. 27-9, "argumentum lunare, quando et qualiter observentur tempora ad res agendas."  
Of the twelfth century, Vienna 2532, fols. 55-9, "Luna I. Hec dies omnibus egrotantibus utilis est .../... Puer natus negotia multa sectabit."   

In later manuscripts at least it is further stated that certain Biblical characters were born on this day or that day of the moon: Adam on the first. Eve on the second, Cain on the third, Abel on the fourth, and so on  [^9:2]

 [^9:2]: Sloane 2461, end of 13th century, fols. 62-4. No Biblical character is mentioned for the fifth and sixth days, but we are told that on the seventh day of the moon Abel was slain by Cain.   
BN 3660A, 16th century, fols. 53r-57r, ascribes the birth of Nebuchadnezzar to the fifth day, leaves the sixth blank, has Abel slain on the seventh, Methusaleh born on the eighth, Lamech on the ninth, and so on.   
Egerton 821, 12th century, fol. 12r, "Natus est Samuel propheta. . . ."   
Digby 88, 15th century, fol. 62r, has English verses beginning:   
"God made Adam the first day of the moon,   
And the second day Eve good dedis to doone."   
A similar poem occurs at fol. 64 of the same MS and in Ashmole 189, fol. 213V. 

### Authorship of moon-books.

In the early manuscripts moon-books are anonymous or ascribed to Daniel, but in later medieval manuscripts other authors are named. The name of Adam is coupled with that of Daniel in both of two rather elaborate moon-books in a fourteenth century manuscript,  [^10:1] where Adam is said to have worked out these " lunations" "by true experience." 

 [^10:1]: Ashmole 361, mid 14th century, fols. 156V-158V, "Iste sunt lunaciones quas Adam primus homo disposuit secundum veram experientiam quam etiam suis filiis tradidit et quam maxima Abel et ceteris de posteritate ad quos etiam concordavit Daniel propheta . . ."; fol. 159, "Modo agitur de numero lune ad videndum que sit bona vel que mala et usum istarum lunacionum invenerunt Adam et Daniel propheta." 

A fifteenth century one is attributed to a philosopher, astrologer, and physician named Edris,  [^10:2] perhaps the Esdras of the method of divination by the kalends of January rather than the Arab Edrisi. It briefly predicts from the relation of the moon to the twelve signs whether patients will recover and captives escape. In a sixteenth century manuscript at Paris are 

 [^10:2]: Canon. Misc. 517, fol. 35r, "Incipit scientia edita ab edri philosopho astrologo et medico." 

> "Significations of the days of the moon which the most excellent astronomer Bezogar revealed to his disciples and transmitted to them as a very great secret and most precious gift."  [^10:3] 

 [^10:3]: BN 3660A, fols. 53r-57r. In the catalogue of Ashburnham MSS at Florence the name of Giovannino di Graziano is connected with a moon-book in Ashburnham 130, 13-15th century, fols. 25-6, "Luna prima Adam natus fuit. . , ." But perhaps this name should go only with some prognostications, exorcisms, and recipes which occur at the close of the predictions for the thirty days of the moon. 

But such an ascription is rather obviously a late fiction. 

### Spheres of life and death: in Greek.

Determining the fate of the patient from the day of the moon upon which his illness was incurred enters also into certain spheres of life and death which were much employed in the early middle ages. But in these the number of the day of the moon is combined with a second number obtained by a numerical evaluation of the letters forming the patient's name. This method came down from the ancient Greek-speaking world, as in a "The Sphere of Democritus, prognostic of life and death" found in a Leyden papyrus,  [^10:4] 

 [^10:4]: Ed. Leemans, 1833-1885. 

while the very similar  Circle of Petosiris, the mythical Egyptian astrologer, is variously dated by W.Kroll from the second century before Christ, by E.Riess from the first century before Christ, and by F. Boll in the first century of our era.  [^11:1] 

 [^11:1]: Bouché-Leclercq (1899), 537- 42; (1879-1882), I, 258-65. Berthelot, _Alchimistes_ grecs (1888), 1, 86-90. K.Sudhoff (1902), pp. 4-6.

The so-called "Sphere" is really only a wheel of fortune, circle, or other plane figure divided into compartments where different numbers are grouped under such headings as "Life" and "Death." Having calculated the value of a person's name by adding together the Greek numerals represented by its component letters, and having further added in the day of the moon, one divides the sum by some given divisor and looks for the quotient in the compartments. This method of divination was also employed in regard to fugitive slaves and the outcome of gladiatorial combats.  [^11:2] 

 [^11:2]: Arundel 310, 13th century, fol.  2r, Versus de faustis vel infaustis nominibus pugnantium, is a medieval Latin example.

### Medieval Latin versions.
 
In the medieval Latin versions of these spheres of life and death the numerical value of the Greek letters was naturally usually lost and arbitrary numerical equivalents were assigned to the Roman letters or some other method of calculation was substituted. The _Sphere of Petosiris_ was perpetuated in the form of a letter by him to Nechepso, king of Egypt.  [^11:3] 

 [^11:3]: Printed among treatises of dubious or spurious authorship with Bede's works, Migne, PL 90, 963-6; and more recently in Riess’ edition of the fragments of Nechepso and Petosiris (_Philologus_, Suppl. VI, 1891-1893, pp. 382-3) from Cod. Laur. X XXVIII, 24, 9-10th century, fol. 174v. Wickersheimer (1913), pp. 315-7, notes BN 17868, roth century, fol. 13. For other MSS see Appendix I to this chapter.

But more common than this in manuscripts of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries was the Sphere of life and death of Apuleius or Pythagoras or both  [^11:4] which replaced that of Democritus.   
Like it, it consisted of the numbers from one to thirty arranged in six compartments, three above a line each containing six numbers, and three below the line having four each. John of Salisbury, in the twelfth century, presumably refers to it when he speaks of divination or lot-casting 

 [^11:4]: Printed by Paul Lehmann, _Apuleius fragmente_, Hermes XLIX (1914), 612-20. For a list of some MSS of it see Appendix I at the close of this chapter.

"by inspection of the so-called Pythagorean table";  [^12:1] 

 [^12:1]: _Polycraticus_ I, 13, ed. Webb, I, 54. Mr.Webb in a note refers to an article in a German periodical (K.Gillert, _Neues Archiv d. Gesellschaft f. altere deutsche Geschichtskunde_, V, 254) concerning a MS of the _Sphere of Pythagoras_ preserved at Petrograd, but says nothing of the MSS in the British Museum listed in Appendix I to this chapter, - a good illustration of the unnecessary obsequiousness of English towards German scholarship which has frequently prevailed in the past. 

and it continues to be found with great frequency in the manuscripts of subsequent centuries.  [^12:2] 

 [^12:2]: A few of them will be found listed in Appendix I to this chapter. 

It is not to be confused, however, with the _Prenostica Pitagorice_, a more elaborate, although somewhat similar, method of divination by means of geomantic tables, of which we shall treat later in the chapter on Bernard Silvester. A Sphere ascribed to St. Donatus in a twelfth century manuscript includes instructions how to determine the sign of the zodiac under which a person was born by computing the difference between his name and his mother's name. If this amounts to four letters, he was born under the fourth sign, and so on.  [^12:3] 

 [^12:3]: Egerton 821, 12th century, fol. 15r, "Hec est spera quod fecit sanctus Donatus. Quicumque egrotare incipit. . . ." It is followed on the next page by the usual figure for the Sphere of Apuleius. 

### Survival of such methods in medical practice of about 1400.

The survival of such superstitious methods of divination into the later middle ages is attested not only by the frequent recurrence of the Sphere of Apideius and the divinations from the kalends of January in manuscripts of the later centuries, but by the medical notebook, written in middle English, of John Crophill, who practiced medicine in Suffolk under Henry IV.  [^12:4] 

 [^12:4]: Harleian 1735; the passages referred to in the following account occur at fols. 36V, 41, 43, 29, 44V, 40, and 39V respectively. 

Besides a record of his patients and the sums of money due from them, rules of dieting and blood-letting for the twelve months of the year, and his "more regular and masterly observations upon Urin," his notes include a treatise on astrological medicine which, in the sarcastic language of the old catalogue of the Harleian Manuscripts, concludes "with a masterpiece of art, namely, a treaty or chapter of 'Calculation to know what thou wilt,' and this by observation of persons' names." The notebook also contains "Oracular Answers prepared beforehand by this great Doctor for those of both Sexes who shall come to consult him in the momentous affair of Matrimony; according to the several Months of the year wherein they should apply themselves." Further contents are an incantation in Latin for women in child-birth, and "The names of the 12 signs with such marks as shew that this John Crophill was a dabbler in Geomancy." 

### Egyptian days.

Brief lists of "Egyptian Days" are of rather common occurrence in both Latin and Anglo-Saxon manuscripts of the ninth, tenth, and succeeding centuries.  [^15:1] 

 [^15:1]: See Appendix II to this chapter for a list of MSS other than those mentioned in the following  notes. 

Often it is merely stated what days of the year they are; sometimes it is simply added that the doctor should not bleed the patient upon them. As early as a ninth century manuscript  [^15:2] however, we are further warned not to take a walk or plant or carry on a lawsuit or do any work upon these days. 

 [^15:2]: BN nouv. acq. 1616, 9th century, fol. 12r.

And under no circumstances, no matter what the seeming necessity, is it permitted to bleed man or beast on these days. Two Egyptian days are then listed for each month, one reckoned as so many days from the beginning and the other as so many days before the close of the month.   
Eleven days is the farthest removed that any Egyptian day is from the first of the month and twelve the most from the close, so that they never fall in the middle of a month nor on the very first or last day.  
Our ninth century manuscript then mentions three of these days in April, August, and December as especially dangerous. Whoever falls ill or receives a potion on them is sure to die soon. Whoever, male or female, is born on one of them will die an evil and painful death. 

> "And if one drinks water on those three days, he will die within forty days." 

The account then closes with the statement that on the Egyptian days the people of Egypt were cursed with Pharaoh. In another ninth century manuscript a bare list of the Egyptian days is followed by a somewhat similar account of the three which must be observed with especial care.  [^13:1] 

 [^13:1]: Digby 63, end of 9th century, fol. 36.

In a calendar of saints' days in this same manuscript only the third of March and the third of July are marked _dies egiptiagus_.  [^13:2] 

 [^13:2]: Digby 63, end of 9th century, fols. 40-5.

Egyptian days are also marked in the calendar of Marianus Scotus, the well- known chronicler and chronologist.  [^13:3] 

 [^13:3]: CU Trinity 1369, 11th century,fol. IV.

A somewhat different account in a twelfth century manuscript states that "these are the days which God sent without mercy." It also, however, lists two of them for each month and distinguishes the three in April, August, and December as especially dangerous.  [^13:4] 

 [^13:4]: BN 7299A, 12th century, fol. 37V.

### Their history.

There seems to be no doubt that these Egyptian days were a relic of the unlucky days in the ancient calendar,  [^13:5] of which we learn from several papyri, although of course the ancient Egyptians were also accustomed to distinguish further the three divisions of each day as lucky or unlucky. 

 [^13:5]: For further information on this point see Budge, _Egyptian Magic_, 1899, pp. 225-8; Webster, _Rest Days_, 1916, pp. 295-7.

The Egyptian days are noted in official calendars of the Roman Empire about 354 A. D., and in the _Fasti Philocaliarci_ there are twenty-five in all, of which three fall in January. In the middle ages, as has already been illustrated, there were usually but twenty-four, two to each month.  [^13:6] 

 [^13:6]: Webster (1916), pp. 300-301, however, speaks of 30 in a 14th century MS, 32 in an English MS of Henry VI’s reign, and 31 in another 15th century MS.

They were mentioned in the _Life of Proclus_ by Marinus, and both Ambrose and Augustine testified that many Christians still had faith in them.  [^13:7] 

 [^13:7]: Cited by  Bouché-Leclercq, _L'Astrologie grecque_, 189, pp. 485-6, 623. 

Indeed, they passed into the ecclesiastical calendar, as the Franciscan, Bartholomew of England, states in the thirteenth century.  [^13:8] 

 [^13:8]: _De proprietatibus rerum_, 1488, Lindelbach, Heidelberg, IX, 20. This is not to say, however, that they always appear in medieval calendars; I did not find them in any of the 14th and 15th century calendars from Apulia and lapygia published by G.M.Giovene, _Kalendaria vetera_, Naples, 1828. His calendars consist of little save saints’ days, although in some of them the beginning of dog-days is marked and when the sun enters each sign of the zodiac. 

### Medieval attempts to explain them.

By that time the notion had become prevalent that they were anniversaries of the days upon which God afflicted Egypt with plagues, as our citations from the manuscripts have shown. Bartholomew, indeed, is at pains to explain that the days are placed in the church calendar, "not because one should omit anything upon them more than upon other days, but in order that God's miracles may be recalled to memory." The circumstance that there are twenty-four days does not embarrass him; he simply explains that this proves that God sent more plagues upon Egypt than the ten which are especially famed. Our citations from earlier manuscripts have shown that most people would not agree with Bartholomew that nothing should be omitted on these days. Moreover, other explanations of their origin had been already given in the middle ages than that from the plagues of Egypt. Honorius of Autun stated in the twelfth century that they were called Egyptian days because they had been discovered by the Egyptians, and since Egypt means dark  [^14:1] 

 [^14:1]: "Black earth" was the name given by the Egyptians to their country. 

they are called tenebrosi, because they are declared to bring the incautious to the shadows of death.  [^14:2] 

 [^14:2]: _Imago mundi_, II, 109. 

The Dominican, Vincent of Beauvais,  [^14:3] who probably wrote his encyclopedia soon after that of Bartholomew, did not find the discrepancy between ten plagues and twenty-four days so easy to explain away. He states that of the two Egyptian days in each month one comes near the beginning and the other near the close, as we have already learned. 

 [^14:3]: _Speculum natiirale_, XVI, 83, printed by Anth. Koburger, N&uuml;rnberg, 1485.  

He adds that some call them lucky days, while others say that the astrologers of Egypt discovered that they were unlucky. Yet another explanation of their origin is that on these days the Egyptians were accustomed to sacrifice to demons with their own blood, a circumstance which would not seem to recommend them for inclusion in the ecclesiastical calendar. Bernard Gordon, a medical writer at the end of the thirteenth century, reverts to the position that the Egyptian days were in memory of the plagues in Egypt.   
He declares that there is no sense in the prohibition of blood-letting upon these days, since they have no astrological significance, but are the anniversaries of miracles worked by special providence.  [^15:1] 

 [^15:1]: HL 25, 329. My impression is that some medieval astronomers also denied to these Egyptian days any astrological importance, since they always came upon the same days of the months without reference to the phases of the moon or courses of the other planets: but I cannot put my hand on such passages.

Gilbert of England, earlier in the thirteenth century, had advised against bleeding on Egyptian days, if the moon was then influenced by any evil planet.  [^15:2] 

 [^15:2]: And is approvingly cited to that effect by Arnald of Villanova, _Regulae generales curationis morborum_. Doctrina IV.

### Other perilous days

On the other hand, not only did the twenty-four Egyptian days and the three in April, August, and December which were considered especially dangerous, continue to be listed in the fourteenth and fifteenth century manuscripts, but imitations of them appeared. Thus in a fourteenth century manuscript we read of forty perilous days which should be observed with the utmost care and which Greek masters have tested by experience;  [^15:3] 

 [^15:3]: Ashmole 361, mid 14th century, fols. 158v-159.

while in a second manuscript of the closing medieval period appear fifty-eight dangerous days "according to the Arabs."   [^15:4] 

 [^15:4]: BN 7337, 14-15th century, p. 75. Ad-Damîrî states in his zoological lexicon, (ed. A.S.G.Jayaker, 1906, I, 134) that Mohammed is reported to have said, “Be cautious of twelve days in the year, because they are such as cause the loss of property and bring on disgrace or dishonor.”

Of the Greek days only twenty-nine are actually listed, seven in January, three in February, and so on, omitting the months of July and Au- gust entirely, which perhaps should contain the missing eleven days.  [^15:5] The Arabic days vary in number per month from seven in March, which is the first month listed, to three in February. 

 [^15:5]: SM.Hamilton, _Greek Saints and Their Festivals_, 1910, p. 187, States that “in all parts of (modern) Greece on certain days of August and March it is considered necessary to abstain from particular kinds of work in order to avoid disaster.”

"And there are four other days and nights according to Bede on which no one is ever born or conceived, and if by chance a male is conceived or bom, its body will never be freed from putridity."  [^16:1] 

 [^16:1]: “Mention may perhaps be made in this connection of the “Tobias nights,” three nights of abstinence which newly wedded couples were sometimes accustomed to observe in the middle ages in order to defeat the demons. The practice is mentioned in the Vulgate, but not in most ancient versions of the _Book of Tobit_. In 1409 the citizens of Abbeville won a lawsuit with the bishop of Amiens who claimed the right to grant dispensations from the observance of the Tobias nights and  required that fees be paid him for that purpose. See J.G.Frazer (1918), J, 498-520, where analogous practices of primitive tribes are listed.

### Firmicus read by an archbishop of York.

That astrological knowledge in England, at least soon after the Norman conquest, was not limited to such meager and simple treatises as the moon-books described above from Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, is seen from the closing incident in the career of Gerard, a learned and eloquent man, bishop of Hereford under William Rufus and archbishop of York under Henry I, whom he supported in the investiture struggle with Anselm and the pope.  
The story goes that Gerard, who had been feeling slightly indisposed, lay down to rest and enjoy the fresh air and fragrance of the flowers in a garden near his palace, asking his chaplains to leave him for a while. On their return after dinner they found him dead, and beneath the cushion upon which his head rested was a copy of the astrological work of Julius Firmicus Maternus. Gerard had not been popular with the inhabitants of York, and when his corpse was brought back to town, boys stoned the bier and the canons refused it burial within the cathedral, which, however, his successor granted. 

> "His enemies," we are told, "interpreted his death, without the rites of the church, as a divine judgment for his addiction to magical and forbidden arts." 

At any rate the story shows that the work of Firmicus was well known by this time; it is from the eleventh century that the oldest manuscripts of it date; and we suspect that some of his enemies were rather hypocritical in the horror which they expressed at a bishop's reading such a book. 

> "Too independent a thinker for his contemporaries," writes Miss Bateson, "his opponents held up their hands in horror that an astrological work by Julius Firmicus Maternus should be found under his pillow when he died."  [^17:1] 

 [^17:1]: Bateson, Medieval England, 1904, p. 72; I have in the main followed the fuller account in DNB "Gerard," from which the previous quotation is taken. William of Malmesbury, Gesta Pontificum Anglorum, III, 118 (ed. N.E.S.A.Hamilton, RS, vol. 52, 1870) does not say definitely that the book found under Gerard's pillow was Firmicus. Also he says nothing of boys stoning the bier or of Gerard's enemies interpreting his death as a divine judgment, and in his autograph copy of the Gesta Pontificum he afterwards erased the statements that rumor accused Gerard of many crimes and lusts, and that he was said to practice sorcery because he read Julius Firmicus on the sly before the mid-day hours, and that people say that a book of curious arts was found beneath his pillow when he died. This, the late medieval chroniclers say, was Firmicus: see Ranulf Higden, ed. Lumby, VII, 420, and Knyghton, ed. Twysden, X, SS., 2375. 

The style of Firmicus is much imitated by the anonymous author of _The Laws of Henry I_ and another legal work entitled _Quadripartitus_ written in 1114. F.Liebermann states that the author was in the service of archbishop Gerard aforesaid.  [^17:2] 

 [^17:2]: Firmicus Maternus, ed. Kroll et Skutsch, II (1913), p. iv; and F.Liebermann, ed. _Quadripartitus_, Halle, 1892, p. 36, and _Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen_, Halle, 1903-1906, I, 548. 

### Relation of Latin astrology to Arabic.

Charles Jourdain once made the generalization that be- fore the translation of the _Quadripartite_ of Ptolemy and the works of the Arabian astrologers into Latin in the twelfth century, astrology had little hold among men of learning in western Europe.  [^17:3] 

 [^17:3]: C.Jourdain, _Nicolas Oresme et les astrologues a la cour de Charles V_, in _Revue des Questions Historiques_, 1875, p. 136. 

An even more erroneous assertion was that in Burckhardt's _Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien_ that 

> "at the beginning of the thirteenth century" the superstition of astrology "suddenly appeared in the foreground of Italian life."  [^17:4] 

 [^17:4]: English translation, ed. of 1898, p. 508. 

Even Jourdain's assertion the entire present chapter tends to disprove, but since it has been quoted with approval by a subsequent writer on the thirteenth century,  [^17:5] we may deal with it a little farther. The reason which Jourdain added in support of his generalization was that before the translations from the Arabic 

 [^17:5]: N.Valois (1880), p. 305.

> "those who cultivated astrology had no other guides than Censorinus, Manilius, and Julius Firmicus, who might indeed seduce a few isolated dreamers but did not have enough weight to convince philosophers. Ptolemy and the Arabs, on the con- trary, appeared as masters of a regular science having its own principles and method." 

This sounds as if Jourdain had not read Firmicus who gives a more elaborate presentation of the art of astrology than the elementary _Quadripartite_ of Ptolemy. It is true that Ptolemy had a great scientific reputation from his other writings, but Manilius is a poet of no small merit, and there would be no reason why an age which accepted Ovid and Vergil as authorities concerning nature and regarded such works as _De vetula_ and the Secret of Secrets as genuine works of Ovid and Aristotle, should draw delicate distinctions between Firmicus and Albumasar or Manilius and Alkindi. It was because reading Firmicus and even practicing the cruder modes of divination which we have described had already aroused an interest in astrology that other works in the field were sought out and translated.  
Moreover, there is an even more cogent objection to Jourdain's generalization which will be developed in the following chapter, and it is that the taking over of Arabic astrology had already begun long before the twelfth century. We have, indeed, in the present chapter told only half the story of astrology in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and must now turn back to Gerbert and the introduction of Arabic astrology.

Harleian 1585 and Sloane 1975, where the Egyptian days are found with the _Herbarium of Apuleius_, are both 12th century but probably copied from earher MSS.   
So in Chalons-sur-Marne 7, 13th century, fol. 41, verses on the Egyptian days occur with the _Ars calculatoria_ of Helpericus of Auxerre who wrote in the ninth century. 

I have usually not noted the occurrence of the Egyptian 
days in later manuscripts. A few exceptions are: 

BN 7299A, 12th century, fol. 37r. 
CLM 23390, 12-13th century, the last item is, "Verses concerning the twelve signs and the Egyptian days." The previous contents were mainly religious.

The verses concerning the ten plagues of Egypt contained in CLM 18629, 10th century, fol. 93, and ascribed by the catalogue to Eugenius Toletanus have, I presume, no connection with the Egyptian days. Such proved to be the case with BN 16216, 13th century, fol. 25 iv, de decem plagis Egyptiorum et de vii diebus, although from the fact that it follows "Precepta Pithagore" I suspected before examining it that it might have something to do with divination. But not even the Pythagorean precepts have in this case.
