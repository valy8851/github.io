Themes of HAVING noted the presence of magic in works so espe- 
cially devoted to natural science as those of Pliny, Galen, 
and Ptolemy, we have now to illustrate the prominence both 
of natural science and of magic in the life and thought of 
the Roman Empire by a consideration of some writers of a 
more miscellaneous character, who should reflect for us 
something of the interests of the average cultured reader of 
that time. Of this type are Plutarch, Apuleius and Philos- 
tratus, whom we shall consider in the coming chapters in 
the order named, which also roughly corresponds to their 
chronological sequence. 

Plutarch flourished during the reigns of Trajan and 
Hadrian at the turn of the first and second centuries, but 
The Letter on the Education of a Prince to Trajan ^ 
probably is not by him, and the legend that Hadrian was his 
pupil is a medieval invention. He was born in Boeotia about 
46-48 A. D. and was educated in rhetoric and philosophy, 
science and mathematics, at Athens, where he was a student

when Nero visited Greece in 66 A. D. He also made 
several visits to Rome and resided there for some time. He 
held various public positions in the province of Achaea and 
in his small native tov^n of Chaeronea, and had official con- 
nections with the Delphic oracle and amphictyony. Artemi- 
dorus in the Oneirocriticon states that Plutarch's death was 
foreshadowed in a dream. ^ 

With Plutarch's celebrated Lives of Illustrious Men, as Super- 
with narrative histories in general, we shall not be much piutarch's 
concerned, although they of course abound in omens and L.^'^es. 
portents, in bits of pseudo-science which details in his nar- 
rative bring to the mind of the biographer, and in cases of 
divination and magic. Thus theories are advanced to ex- 
plain why birds dropped dead from mid-air at the shout set 
up by the Greeks at the Isthmian games when Flamininus 
proclaimed their freedom. Or we are told how Sulla re- 
ceived from the Chaldeans predictions of his future great- 
ness, how in the dedication to his Memoirs he admonished 
Lucullus to trust in dreams, and how Lucullus's mind was 
deranged by a love philter administered by his freedman in 
the hope of increasing his master's affection towards him.^ 
Such allusions and incidents abound also of course in Dio 
Cassius, Tacitus, and other Roman historians. 

But we shall be concerned rather with Plutarch's other His 
writings, which are usually grouped together under the title Essays. ^^ 
of Morals, or, more appropriately, Miscellanies and Es- 
says. Not only is there great variety in their titles, but in 
any given essay the attention is usually not strictly held to 
one theme or problem but the discussion diverges to other 
points. Some are by their very titles and form rambling 
dialogues, symposiacs, and table-talk, where the conversation 
lightly flits from one topic to other entirely different ones, 
never dwelling for long upon any one point and never re-

turning to its starting-point. This dinner-table and drink- 
ing-bout type of cultured and semi-learned discourse has 
other extant ancient examples such as the Attic Nights of 
Aulus Gellius and the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus, but 
Plutarch will have to serve as our main illustration of it. 
His Essays reflect in motley guise and disordered array the 
fruits of extensive reading and a retentive memory in ancient 
philosophy, science, history, and literature. 

The authenticity of some of the essays attributed to him 
has been questioned, and very likely with propriety, but for 
our purpose it is not important that they should all be by 
the same author so long as they represent approximately the 
same period and type of literature. The spurious treatise, 
De placitis philosophorimi, we have already considered in 
the chapter on Galen, to whom it has also been ascribed. The 
essay On Rivers and Mountains we shall treat by itself in 
the present chapter. The De fato has also been called spuri- 
ous.^ Superstitious content is not a sufficient reason for 
denying that a treatise is by Plutarch,^ since he is super- 
stitious in writings of undoubted genuineness and since we 
have found the leading scientists of the time unable to ex- 
clude superstition from their works entirely. Moreover, 
many of the essays are in the form of conversations ex- 
pressing the divergent views of different speakers, and it is 
not always possible to tell which shade of opinion Plutarch 
himself favors. Suffice it that the views expressed are those 
of men of education. 

Plutarch does not specifically discuss magic under that 
name at any length in any of his essays, but does treat of

such subjects as superstition in general, dreams, oracles, 
demons, number, fate, the craftiness of animals, and other 
"natural questions." Certain vulgar forms of magic, at 
least, were regarded by him with disapproval or incredul- 
ity.^ He rejects as a fiction the statement that the women 
of Thessaly can draw down the moon by their spells, but 
thinks that the notion perhaps originated in the fact or story 
that Aglaonice, daughter of Hegetor, was so skilful in as- 
trology or astronomy as to be able to foresee the occurrence 
of lunar eclipses, and that she deluded the people into believ- 
ing that at such times she brought down the moon from 
heaven by charms and enchantments.- Thus we have one 
more instance of the union of magic and science, this time 
of pseudo-magic with real science as at other times of magic 
with pseudo-science. 

The essay entitled vrepl btiaibaniovlas deals with super- Essay on

fear of demons and gods. We are accustomed to think of 
Hellenic paganism as a cheerful faith, full of naturalism, in 
which the gods were humanized and made familiar. Plu- 
tarch apparently regards normal religion as of this sort, and 
attacks the superstitious dread of the supernatural. He con- 
tends that such fear is worse, if anything, than atheism, for 
it makes men more unhappy and is an equal offense against 
the divinity, since it is at least as bad to believe ill of the 
gods as not to believe in them at all. Nothing indeed encour- 
ages the growth of atheism so much as the absurd practices 
and beliefs of such superstitious persons, "their words and

motions, their sorceries and magics, their runnings to and 
fro and beatings of drums, their impure rites and their 
purifications, their filthiness and chastity-, their barbarian 
and illegal chastisements and abuse." ^ Plutarch seems to 
be in part animated by the common prejudice against all 
other religions than cHie's own. and speaks twice with dis- 
taste of Jewish Sabbaths. He also, however, as the passage 
just quoted shows, is opposed to the more extreme and de- 
basing forms of magic, and declares that the superstitious 
man becomes a mere peg or post upon which all the old- 
wives hang any amulets and ligatures upon which they may 
chance.- He further condemns such historic instances of 
superstition as Xicias's suspension of military operations 
during a lunar eclipse on the Sicilian expedition.^ There was 
nothing terrible, says Plutarch, with his usual felicity of an- 
tithesis, in the periodic reoirrence of the earth's shadow 
upon the moon; but it was a terrible calamitv* that the 
shadow of superstition should thus darken the mind of a 
general at the very moment when a great crisis required the 
fullest use of his reason. 
-:"tarch In the essay upon the demon of Socrates one of the 

^;l"^"'*^ speakers, attacking faith in dreams and apparitions, com- 
mends Socrates as one who did not reject the worship of 
the gods but who did purify philosophy, which he had re- 
ceived from P}-thagoras and Empedocles full of phantasms 
and myths and the dread of demons, and reeling like a Bac- 
chanal, and reduced it to facts and reason and truth.* An- 
other of the company, however, objects that the demon of 
Socrates outdid the divination of P\thagoras.^ These con- 
flicting opinions may be applied in some measiu-e to Plutarch 
himself. His censtu"e of dread of demons and excessive 
superstition is not to be taken as a sign of scepticism on 
his part in oracles, dreams, or the demons themselves. To 
these matters we next tturu

Plutarch's faith and interest in oracles in general and The 

, . . , , oracles of 

in the Delphian oracle ot Apollo in particular are attested Delphi and 

by three of his essays, the De defectu oraculorum, De Py- '^X^^^ 
thme oracuUs and De Ei apud Delphos. At the same time 
these essays attest the decline of the oracles from their earlier 
popularity" and greatness. The oracular cave of Trophonius, 
of which we shall hear again in the Life of Apollonius of 
Tyana, also comes into Plutarch's works, and the prophetic 
and apocal}'ptic vision is described of a youth who spent two 
nights and a day there in an endeavor to learn the nature 
of the demon of Socrates.^ 

Plutarch further had faith in divination in general, Divination 
whether by dreams, sneezes or other omens: but he attempted 
to give a dignified philosophical and theological explana- 
tion of it. Few men receive direct divine revelation, in his 
opinion, but to many signs are given on which divination 
may be based.- He held that the human soul had a natural 
faculty of di%-ination which might be exercised at favorable 
times and when the bodily state was not unfavorable.^ A 
speaker in one of his dialogues justifies divination even from 
sneezes and like trivial occurrences upon the ground that as 
the faint beat of the pulse has meaning for the ph}*sician and 
a small cloud in the sk}- is for a skilful pilot a sign of im- 
pending storm, so the least thing may be a clue to the truly- 
prophetic soul.^ The extent of Plutarch's faith in dreams 
may be inferred from his discussion of the problem. Why 
are dreams in autumn the least reliable ? ^ First there is 
Aristotle's suggestion that eating autumn fruit so disturbs 
the digestion that the soul is left little opportunity to ex- 
ercise its prophetic faculty- undistracted. If we accept the 
doctrine of Democritus that dreams are caused by images 
from other bodies and even minds or souls, which enter the 
body of the sleeper through the open pores and affect the 
mind, revealing to it the present passions and future de-

signs of others, - if we accept this theory, it may be that 
the falling leaves in autumn disturb the air and ruffle these 
extremely thin and film-like emanations. A third explana- 
tion offered is that in the declining months of the year all 
our faculties, including that of natural divination, are in a 
state of decline. In the case of oracles like that at Delphi it 
is suggested that the Pythia's natural faculty of divination 
is stimulated by "the prophetical exhalations from the earth" 
which induce a bodily state favorable to divination.^ The 
god or demon, however, is the underlying and directing 
cause of the oracle.- 

To the demons and their relations to the gods and to 
men we therefore next come. Plutarch's view is that they 
are essential mediators between the gods and men. Just as 
one who should remove the air from between the earth and 
moon would destroy the continuity of the universe, so those 
who deny that there is a race of demons break ofif all inter- 
course between gods and men.^ On the other hand, the 
theory of demons solves many doubts and difficulties.-'* 
When and where this doctrine originated is uncertain, 
whether among the magi about Zoroaster, or in Thrace with 
Orpheus, or in Egypt or Phrygia. Plutarch likens the gods 
to an equilateral, the demons to an isosceles, and human be- 
ings to a scalene triangle; and again compares the gods to 
sun and stars, the demons to the moon, and men to comets 
and meteors.^ In the youth's vision in the cave of Tro- 
phonius the moon appeared to belong to earthly demons, 
while those stars which have a regular motion were the 
demons of sages, and the wandering and falling stars the 
demons of men who have yielded to irrational passions.® 

These suggestions that the moon and the air between 
earth and moon are the abode of the demons and this remi- 
niscence of the Platonic doctrine of the soul and its migra- 
tions receive further confirmation in a discussion whether
